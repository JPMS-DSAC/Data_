EAD PMAA AO 4 201819] UNDER SECTION 15I OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA ACT 1992 READ WITH RULE 5 OF SEBI PROCEDURE FOR HOLDING INQUIRY AND IMPOSING PENALTIES BY ADJUDICATING OFFICER RULES 1995 In respect of Shri Parag Kishorekumar Ajmera PAN ABIPA4469L In the matter of Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited FACTS OF THE CASE IN BRIEF 1.
1,F1524823884607_S2,Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI conducted investigation in the scrip of Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited hereinafter referred to as “Company MCX” for the period of April 27 2012 to July 31 2013.
2,F1524823884607_S3,It was observed in investigation that National Spot Exchange Limited NSEL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Technologies India Ltd “FTIL” which also holds 26% of the shareholding in MCX.
3,F1524823884607_S4,Further all three companies i.e  NSEL FTIL and MCX are under a common management with common directors and employees.
4,F1524823884607_S5,A Show Cause Notice dated April 27 2012 was issued by the Department of Consumer Affairs DCA SCN to NSEL.
5,F1524823884607_S6,As per the Investigating Authority the Unpublished Price Sensitive Information “UPSI” in respect of the shares of MCX was the implication of the DCA SCN dated April 27 2012 issued to NSEL i.e  suspension of short selling by its Members pairing of contracts and settlement of contracts beyond 11 Adjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX days and impending payment defaults by the members of NSEL and loss of reputation of Promoters and Management of MCX.
6,F1524823884607_S7,It was observed that any news impacting business of NSEL will automatically impact share price of its holding company i.e  FTIL and associate companies i.e  MCX and any news impacting credentials of Promoters and Management of FTIL NSEL and MCX will also impact the share price of MCX therefore suspension of trading by NSEL was a negative news.
7,F1524823884607_S8,As per the Investigating Authority the UPSI came into existence on April 27 2012 upon the issuance of the SCN to NSEL by the DCA and it ceased to exist when NSEL suspended trading in all contracts except eseries contracts and deferred settlement of all pending contracts on July 31 2013.
8,F1524823884607_S9,FTIL being the holding company of NSEL Directors and Officers of FTIL were reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from its wholly owned subsidiary company i.e  NSEL.
9,F1524823884607_S10,It was observed in the investigation conducted by SEBI that Shri Parag Kishorekumar Ajmera “Noticee” was a senior level employee of FTIL during UPSI period i.e  he was Chief Business Officer of FTIL since November 02 2001.
10,F1524823884607_S11,Noticee was also brother of Shri Paras K Ajmera who was holding senior level position of DirectorOperations and HR of FTIL since October 01 2005.
11,F1524823884607_S12,In that capacity Noticee was reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from NSEL and thus an insider under SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 1992 hereinafter referred to as PIT Regulations 1992.
12,F1524823884607_S13,It was alleged that the Noticee being an insider before the outbreak of NSEL irregularities avoided losses by selling 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Adjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX Regulation 122 of SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 2015 hereinafter referred to as “PIT Regulations 2015”.
13,F1524823884607_S14,The undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer under section 15I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act” read with rule 3 of SEBI Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalty by Adjudicating Officer Rules 1995 hereinafter referred to as the ‘Adjudication Rules’ to inquire into and adjudge under section 15G of the SEBI Act the alleged violations of provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Regulation 122 of PIT Regulations 2015 by the Noticee.
14,F1524823884607_S15,SHOW CAUSE NOTICE REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 6.
15,F1524823884607_S16,A Show Cause Notice no.
16,F1524823884607_S17,EAD AOPM AA OW 31610 2017 dated December 14 2017 hereinafter referred to as “SCN” was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated and penalty be not imposed under section 15G of the SEBI Act 1992 for the alleged violations specified in the SCN.
17,F1524823884607_S18,Vide letters dated January 12 and March 20 2018 Joby Mathew & Associates Advocates filed reply to the SCN on behalf of the Noticee.
18,F1524823884607_S19,The summary of submissions is as follows  Whole T ime Member   WTM of SEBI had v ide an Ex par te o rde r da ted August 2  2017 in i t i a ted a p roceed ing aga ins t ce r ta in ind iv idua ls where in i t was a l leged tha t the sa id ind iv idua ls had t raded in the sc r ip o f MCX on the bas is o f UPSI and the per iod o f UPSI a l leged in the sa id p roceed ing was the same a s in the sub jec t show cause no t i ce .
19,F1524823884607_S20,Fu r the r  i t i s a Adjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX mat te r o f record tha t t he said p roceed ings have been conc luded by the WTMs o rder on January 5  2018.
20,F1524823884607_S21, The WTM has arrived at a conclusion that i the UPSI arose as a result of a Show Cause No t i ce  S CN  da t ed Ap r i l 27  2012 th a t was i ssued by the department of Consumer Affairs to NSEL and i i th e UP S I p e r i o d ceased to ex is t on October 03 2012 when the in format ion and imp l i ca t io n o f t h e sa id S CN wa s p ub l i sh ed i n t h e E cono mic Times.
21,F1524823884607_S22, It is pertinent to note that upon perusal of the subject SCN it is SEBI’s own case that our client had sold only 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 and therefore in view of the findings recorded by the WTM the said trades by our client cannot be said to be based on or during UPSI.
22,F1524823884607_S23,Since the al legat ions in the said WTMs p roceed ings a re iden t ica l to the a l lega t ions in the sub jec t proceedings against our cl ient the subject proceedings deserve to be dropped and may not be proceeded.
23,F1524823884607_S24,In v iew of the said f indings i t is also clear that the trades entered into by our cl ient are not in violat ion of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 or any provisions of law.
24,F1524823884607_S25, You have recently exonerated other noticees without imposing any penalty in connected proceedings arising out of the same set of events.
25,F1524823884607_S26,It is now an admitted position that UPSI period ceased to exist on October 03 2012 when the in format ion and i mp l i ca t io n o f t h e sa id S CN wa s pu b l i shed i n t he E co no mic Times.
26,F1524823884607_S27,Since our client had entered into the sale of 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 he had traded in the scrip when the UPSI period had ceased to exist.
27,F1524823884607_S28,It is therefore our legitimate expectation that the proceedings against our client also be dropped since his sale of 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 also arises in the same of events as the other noticees.
28,F1524823884607_S29,Considering the facts and circumstances of the case reply of Noticee and the Order dated January 05 2018 by the WTM of SEBI under sections 111 114b and 11B of SEBI Act in the scrip of MCX the undersigned is of the opinion that the present matter can be decided on Adjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX the basis of facts materials available on record without personally hearing the Noticee.
29,F1524823884607_S30,CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 9.
30,F1524823884607_S31,The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are  I. Whether Noticee avoided losses by selling 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992? and II.
31,F1524823884607_S32,Does the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15G of SEBI Act?
32,F1524823884607_S33,Before moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of PIT Regulations 1992 which reads as under “Prohibition on dealing communicating or counselling on matters relating to insider trading.
33,F1524823884607_S34,No insider shall— i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deal in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange when in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information; or” 11.
34,F1524823884607_S35,I have perused the written submissions of the Noticee documents available on record and the WTM order dated January 05 2018 in the same matter in different proceedings.
35,F1524823884607_S36,Having considered the same I record my findings hereunder.
36,F1524823884607_S37,I find that Noticee was Chief Business Officer of FTIL since November 02 2001 and also brother of Shri Paras K Ajmera who was holding senior level position of DirectorOperations and HR of FTIL since October 01 2005.
37,F1524823884607_S38,In that capacity Noticee was reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from NSEL.
38,F1524823884607_S39,Further the transactions in question i.e  sale of 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 as specified in the SCN is also a matter of record.
39,F1524823884607_S40,Adjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX 13.
40,F1524823884607_S41,Noticee has brought to my attention the fact that WTM of SEBI vide Order dated January 05 2018 under sections 111 114b and 11B of SEBI Act on the same set of facts and allegations had exonerated certain individuals in a separate proceedings against them in the scrip of MCX and the period of UPSI was the same as in the SCN in the instant adjudication proceedings.
41,F1524823884607_S42,I note that in the said WTM order there was a specific finding with regard to the periodicity of the UPSI which is as under “25.
42,F1524823884607_S43,Having answered the first issue in the affirmative the next issue for consideration is whether the “price sensitive information” was unpublished during the period of investigation.
43,F1524823884607_S44,In this regard it is noted that on October 3 2012 an article appeared in the Economic Times a widely distributed financial newspaper which contained information relating to the issuance of SCN dated April 27 2012 to NSEL majority of the contents of the SCN allegations against NSEL with regard to violation of conditions of DCA notification dated June 5 2007 and the gist of NSEL’s reply to the SCN.
44,F1524823884607_S45,The article also covered the possible action that could be taken by DCA against NSEL i.e  withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide the notification dated June 5 2007.
45,F1524823884607_S46,On a careful perusal of the newspaper article dated October 3 2012 I find that the publication of the said article made the following information public  DCA had issued a show cause notice dated April 27 2012 to NSEL hereby it had found fault with certain types of contracts which were being traded on NSEL.
46,F1524823884607_S47, There were allegations against NSEL that it was permitting short selling on its platform.
47,F1524823884607_S48,It was also alleged that NSEL did not have a stock check facility for validating a members position.
48,F1524823884607_S49, SCN also alleged that all contracts traded on NSEL with a settlement period exceeding11 days were in violation of the provisions of FCRA.
49,F1524823884607_S50, The conduct of NSEL was allegedly in violation of the conditions stipulated in the DCA notification dated June 5 2007.
50,F1524823884607_S51,Adjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX  NSEL had filed its reply to the SCN issued by DCA.
51,F1524823884607_S52, In the event of NSEL failing to file a satisfactory explanation DCA would withdraw the exemption granted vide notification dated June 5 2007 without any further communication.
52,F1524823884607_S53,In my view a reader of the newspaper article dated October 3 2012 containing the information noted above could have deduced the implications of the SCN dated April 27 2012 to a lesser or greater extent depending on his her exposure to the subject matter covered in the newspaper article.
53,F1524823884607_S54,In my view the newspaper article was not speculative in nature as it published precise facts relating to the issuance of SCN and also brought out specific contents of the SCN summarizing the allegations levelled against NSEL and the possible consequences thereof.
54,F1524823884607_S55,The article categorically mentioned that failure on part of NSEL to provide a satisfactory explanation to the allegations levelled in the SCN would result in withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide notification dated June 5 2007.
55,F1524823884607_S56,The said withdrawal of exemption in turn would have had a cascading effect on the contracts being traded on NSEL payment defaults in relation thereto and the eventual loss to the reputation of the promoters management of NSEL.
56,F1524823884607_S57,Considering the above I find that the price sensitive information relating to the implication of the SCN dated April 27 2012 became public from the time when the article relating to the SCN dated April 27 2012 appeared in Economic Times on October 3 2012 and as such ceased to be UPSI from that date.
57,F1524823884607_S58,Accordingly the period during which the period the UPSI existed was from the issuance of the SCN to its publication i.e  from April 27 2012 to October 3 2012.”
58,F1524823884607_S59,I note that in the said order WTM inter alia held that since those individuals did not trade in the shares of MCX when in possession of UPSI the violation of regulation 3i of the PIT Regulations 1992 cannot be established against them.
59,F1524823884607_S60,I have also gone through the charges leveled against the Noticee in the SCN which have arisen out of the same set of facts identical to that of in the WTM Order and I do not find any reason to disagree with the view taken by the WTM about the Adjudication Order in respect of Parag K Ajmera in the matter of MCX periodicity of UPSI i.e  from April 27 2012 to October 3 2012.
60,F1524823884607_S61,Since there was no UPSI in existence at the time of sale of 300 shares of MCX on November 30 2012 by the Noticee therefore I am inclined to conclude that violation of Regulation 3i of the PIT Regulations 1992 by the Noticee as alleged in the SCN dated December 14 2017 do not stand established.
61,F1524823884607_S62,Since the alleged violation is not established against the Noticee Issue No 2 requires no consideration.
62,F1524823884607_S63,ORDER 15.
63,F1524823884607_S64,For the aforesaid reasons Show Cause Notice EAD AO PM AA OW 31610 2017 dated December 14 2017 alleging violations of provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Regulation 122 of PIT Regulations 2015 by the Noticee i.e  Shri Parag Kishorekumar Ajmera is disposed of without imposition of any penalty.
64,F1524823884607_S65,In terms of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copies of this order are sent to Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
