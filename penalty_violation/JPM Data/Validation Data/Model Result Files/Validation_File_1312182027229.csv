1,F1312182027229_S2,Investigation into the affairs relating to buying and selling or dealing in the shares of Gennex Laboratories Limited hereinafter referred to as ‘Noticee 1’ or ‘GLL’ or ‘the company’ was made to ascertain whether any provision of the SEBI Act 1992 and various rules and regulations made there under have been violated.

3,F1312182027229_S4,GLL was incorporated in 1985 as a private limited company and became public limited in 1994.

9,F1312182027229_S10,Thus there is change of 2934036 shares 28.90% wherein all the promoters except Vinod Baid L Lalitha L Vithal Rao and Prudential Investments Ltd had sold transferred their shares.
10,F1312182027229_S11,As per shareholding pattern the major selling promoters were Mercury Fund Management Company Ltd hereinafter referred to as MFMCL 16 36036 shares and Roopshri Finvest 3 32000 shares.
11,F1312182027229_S12,During the period of investigation i.e  April 30 2007 – November 18 2008 MFMCL had sold 29 94394 shares and Roopshri sold 9 08025 shares.
12,F1312182027229_S13,On analyzing the demat statement of MFMCL it was noted that 295300 shares were received in off market from another promoter Prudential Stocks & Securities Limited client ID 14872936 since November 10 2007.
13,F1312182027229_S14,From these shares only 34700 shares were sold in the market during November 1229 2007 and balance 2 60600 shares were transferred to his another BO ID 1201090001221636.
14,F1312182027229_S15,It is also observed that MFMCL had received 9 60 000 shares in off market on July 04 2007 from Vinod Baid CMD of GLL.
15,F1312182027229_S16,However Roopshri was holding 3 32000 shares as on April 1 2007 and its purchase and sale were 6 09556 shares and 9 08025 shares respectively.
16,F1312182027229_S17,As per shareholding pattern for quarter ended June 2007 Vinod Baid was holding 9 64 800 shares 9.51% of the equity capital.
17,F1312182027229_S18,Vinod Baid transferred 960000 shares 9.46% of the equity capital to MFMCL on July 04 2007 and thus Vinod Baid was required to disclose this transfer under Regulation 134 read with Regulation 135 of SEBI PIT Regulations 1992.
18,F1312182027229_S19,On the other hand Mercury was required to submit the disclosure under Regulation 71 of SEBI SAST Regulations 1997 as well as Regulation 131 read with Regulation 135 of SEBI PIT Regulations 1992.
19,F1312182027229_S20,The company in turn was required to disclose to   the stock exchanges under Regulation 136 of SEBI PIT Regulations 1992 and Regulation 73 of SEBI SAST Regulations 1997.
20,F1312182027229_S21,The company had allegedly not informed SEBI about any disclosure either under SEBI SAST Regulations 1997 or SEBI PIT Regulations.
21,F1312182027229_S22,Further BSE has informed that during January 2007 – December 2008 it had received only one disclosure under SEBI SAST Regulations on 31.10.08 given by Religare Securities Ltd and no disclosure under SEBI PIT Regulations.
22,F1312182027229_S23,GLL had made certain corporate announcements during the investigation period some of which were not implemented.
23,F1312182027229_S24,It is noted that on July 4 2007 immediately before the corporate announcement about investment proposal MFMCL had received 9.60 lakh shares in off market from the promoter of GLL i.e  Vinod Baid and sold 9 30850 shares during July 52007 to August 222007.
24,F1312182027229_S25,The price rise during this period was from Rs 24.10 to Rs 26.55.
25,F1312182027229_S26,It is observed that the promoter has transferred the shares in off market to erstwhile promoter MFMCL which in turn sold them in the market taking advantage of the positive announcement by the Company which was never implemented and the Company had also not informed the stock exchanges about subsequent implementation status.
26,F1312182027229_S27,It is indicative of the fact that the Company had planted a false announcement about the aforesaid investment proposal and Vinod Baid had sold his 9.60 lakh shares through MFMCL.
27,F1312182027229_S28,MFMCL had facilitated Vinod Baid in off loading the shares of GLL in the market.
28,F1312182027229_S29,This act of the company Vinod Baid & MFMCL could have been an artifice device to defraud the investors in the market by presenting the company as a lucrative investing option on account of proposed foreign investors.
29,F1312182027229_S30,Thus they might have acted together to play fraud on innocent investors.
30,F1312182027229_S31,In view of the same it was of utmost importance to SEBI to be able to procure information about the corporate announcements and subsequent transfer of shares.
31,F1312182027229_S32,Summons were thereby issued to GLL to provide information.

87,F1312182027229_S88,Copy of bank a c’s statements maintained by the company with State Bank of Hyderabad during January 01 2007 – December 31 2008.
88,F1312182027229_S89,Vide letter dated May 25 2010 the Company asked for additional time of 34 weeks for filing reply to the summons.
89,F1312182027229_S90,SEBI vide letter dated May 26 2010 advised the company to file reply to the aforesaid summons by June 7 2010.
90,F1312182027229_S91,Vide letter dated June 7 2010 the Company submitted that it would file the desired information to SEBI by June 25 2010.
91,F1312182027229_S92,However SEBI was not in receipt of any reply from the Company.
92,F1312182027229_S93,Noticee1 the company vide reply dated June 7 2011 submitted that it had furnished relevant information as sought for by the Board vide its summons dated April 26 2010 May 20 2010 and May 26 2010 letter.
93,F1312182027229_S94,However it had noticed in the SCN that SEBI required specific information as to some queries as notified in page 8 of the Notice and therefore submitted the same as annexure to the reply.
94,F1312182027229_S95,However I find that the information now also being submitted is not complete information as it has not provided the information on all the points raised in the summons.
95,F1312182027229_S96,During the course of the hearing it was pointed out to Noticee1 that the specific queries as laid down in the SCN were only a reproduction of the questions asked vide summons dated May 20 2010 which the company had failed to comply   with.
96,F1312182027229_S97,Summons dated May 20 2010 was absolutely unambiguous about the information required from the company.
97,F1312182027229_S98,Noticee1 submitted that it could not comply with the summons because the officer dealing with the matter had left the service of the company and the COO was not fully aware of the matter.
98,F1312182027229_S99,The company submitted that this non compliance with the summons was not intentional and could have been because of a lack of understanding.
99,F1312182027229_S100,This contention of Noticee1 cannot be accepted.
100,F1312182027229_S101,It was also submitted by the four directors that they were independent and non executive directors who were not involved in the day –today management of the company and were therefore not in a position to comply with the summons.
101,F1312182027229_S102,Mr U. C. Bhandari  Mr Y. Ravinder Reddy and  Mr Kishore Jhunjhunwala in their replies dated July 20 2011 have stated that they was nonexecutive directors and in the said capacity their role in the management of the affairs of the company was very limited more so in matters relating to transfer sale purchase of shares between the company and other entities and vice versa.
102,F1312182027229_S103,During the course of the hearing the Chief Operating Officer of the company also confirmed the submissions of the directors and stated that  Mr Vinod Baid was the Chairman of the Board and not involved in day to day functioning of the company.
103,F1312182027229_S104,The company was managed by independent team of staff members headed by  Mr Gopal Krishnan Executive Director not the board member assisted by COO Shri KVLN Bhaswanth and other staff members.
104,F1312182027229_S105,Mr Ravinder Reddy  Mr Kishore Jhunjhunwala and  Mr U. C. Bhandari were the independent directors on the Board and were not involved in day to day management.
105,F1312182027229_S106,I find that there is no evidence on record to suggest that these directors were involved in the day to day activities of the company.
106,F1312182027229_S107,I therefore tend to give benefit of doubt to the Directors and I do not find Noticee2 Noticee3 Noticee4 and Noticee5 guilty of violating the provisions of Sections 11C 2 and 11C 3 read with 11 C 6 of the SEBI Act 1992.
107,F1312182027229_S108,From the above discussion I find that Noticee1 Gennex Laboratories Ltd did not comply with the summons dated May 20 2010 and therefore violated the provisions of Sections 11C 2 and 11C 3 read with 11 C 6 of the SEBI Act 1992.
108,F1312182027229_S109,Issue 2 Whether the Noticees are liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A a of SEBI Act 1992?
109,F1312182027229_S110,The allegations against Noticee2 Noticee3 Noticee4 and Noticee5 have not been established and they are therefore not liable for penalty under Section 15 A a of the SEBI Act of 1992.
110,F1312182027229_S111,Since the violation of the alleged provisions of law has been established in respect of Noticee1 I believe that this is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under Section 15 A a of the SEBI Act 1992 which reads as under Penalty for failure to furnish information return etc. 15A.
111,F1312182027229_S112,If any person who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder— a to furnish any document return or report to the Board fails to furnish the same he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees whichever is less;
112,F1312182027229_S113,ISSUE 3 What should be the quantum of penalty imposed upon the Noticee in accordance with the principles of Section 15 J of the SEBI Act?
113,F1312182027229_S114,While imposing monetary penalty it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act which reads as under “15J  Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15I the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely a the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage wherever quantifiable made as a result of the default; b the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; c the repetitive nature of the default.”
114,F1312182027229_S115,It is noted that no quantifiable figures are available to assess the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made as a result of the default.
115,F1312182027229_S116,Further the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors also cannot be quantified on the basis of the available facts and data.
116,F1312182027229_S117,However such noncooperation with investigative authorities leads to delay in the unraveling of unfair market practices which results in the erosion of investor confidence in the market.
117,F1312182027229_S118,In the foregoing paragraphs it is now established that Noticee1 Gennex Laboratories Ltd. failed to provide necessary information to the Investigating Authority of SEBI in response to the summons issued in terms of Section 113 of the SEBI Act 1992.
118,F1312182027229_S119,The said information was very relevant and important in the whole investigation process.
119,F1312182027229_S120,It is noted that the company had made certain announcements which did not materialise but had lead to a rise in the price of its shares.
120,F1312182027229_S121,During this period of pricerise it was observed that promoter entities had offloaded their shares in the market.
121,F1312182027229_S122,By not providing this crucial information which could have unraveled serious manipulative or fraudulent practices on the part of the company or entities related to it Noticee1 seriously crippled the investigative process.
122,F1312182027229_S123,In this regard I refer to the observation of the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No 184 of 2010  Mr Jalaj Batra vs  SEBI decided on 06122010; wherein it was held that  “…….
123,F1312182027229_S124,Having regard to the circumstances of this case we are more than satisfied that the summons had in fact been received by the appellant and that he failed to respond to the same.
124,F1312182027229_S125,We have observed time and again that it is of utmost importance that market players like the appellant should fully cooperate with the investigations that are carried out by the Board the watchdog of the securities market.
125,F1312182027229_S126,If market players and intermediaries avoid appearing before the investigating officer or furnish the necessary information sought from them the Board as a market regulator will not be able to carry out its statutory functions and duties of protecting the integrity of the securities market and the investigations would be grossly hampered.
126,F1312182027229_S127,Non cooperation with the market regulator has to be viewed seriously.
127,F1312182027229_S128,We do not know what else would have come to light if the appellant had appeared before the investigating officer or if he had furnished the requisite information that was sought from him.......”
128,F1312182027229_S129,Thereby it is established beyond doubt that Noticee1 tried to elude the Investigating Authority which hampered the investigation process.
129,F1312182027229_S130,Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the violation committed by Noitcee1 I am of the view that imposing a penalty of Rs 10 00000  Rs   Ten Lakhs only on Gennex Laboratories Ltd would be commensurate with the violation of Section 11C 2 and 11C 3 read with Section 11 C 6 of the SEBI Act by Noticee1.
