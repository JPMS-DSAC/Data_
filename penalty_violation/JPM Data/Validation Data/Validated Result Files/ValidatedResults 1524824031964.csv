30,F1524824031964_S31,procedural fact,I have perused the written submissions of the Noticee documents available on record and the WTM order dated January 05 2018 in the Adjudication Order in respect of Dilip Tambe in the matter of MCX same matter in different proceedings.
31,F1524824031964_S32,subjective observation,Having considered the same I record my findings hereunder.
32,F1524824031964_S33,subjective observation,I find that Noticee was a senior level employee of FTIL during the UPSI period i.e  he was Senior Vice President  Communications from September 10 2012 to April 02 2014 and in that capacity he was reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from NSEL.
33,F1524824031964_S34,Subjective Observation,Further the transactions in question i.e  sale of 875 shares of MCX on May 22 2013 as specified in the SCN is also a matter of record.
34,F1524824031964_S35,Subjective Observation,Noticee has brought to my attention the fact that WTM of SEBI vide Order dated January 05 2018 under sections 111 114b and 11B of SEBI Act on the same set of facts and allegations had exonerated certain individuals in a separate proceedings against them in the scrip of MCX and the period of UPSI was the same as in the SCN in the instant adjudication proceedings.
35,F1524824031964_S36,Subjective Observation,I note that in the said WTM order there was a specific finding with regard to the periodicity of the UPSI which is as under “25.
36,F1524824031964_S37,procedural fact,Having answered the first issue in the affirmative the next issue for consideration is whether the “price sensitive information” was unpublished during the period of investigation.
37,F1524824031964_S38,Material Fact,In this regard it is noted that on October 3 2012 an article appeared in the Economic Times a widely distributed financial newspaper which contained information relating to the issuance of SCN dated April 27 2012 to NSEL majority of the contents of the SCN allegations against NSEL with regard to violation of conditions of DCA notification dated June 5 2007 and the gist of NSEL’s reply to the SCN.
38,F1524824031964_S39,material fact,The article also covered the possible action that could be taken by DCA against NSEL i.e  withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide the notification dated June 5 2007.
39,F1524824031964_S40,material fact,On a careful perusal of the newspaper article dated October 3 2012 I find that the publication of the said article made the following information public Adjudication Order in respect of Dilip Tambe in the matter of MCX  DCA had issued a show cause notice dated April 27 2012 to NSEL hereby it had found fault with certain types of contracts which were being traded on NSEL.
40,F1524824031964_S41,Material Fact, There were allegations against NSEL that it was permitting short selling on its platform.
41,F1524824031964_S42,Material Fact,It was also alleged that NSEL did not have a stock check facility for validating a members position.
42,F1524824031964_S43,Material Fact, SCN also alleged that all contracts traded on NSEL with a settlement period exceeding11 days were in violation of the provisions of FCRA.
43,F1524824031964_S44,Material Fact, The conduct of NSEL was allegedly in violation of the conditions stipulated in the DCA notification dated June 5 2007.
44,F1524824031964_S45,Material Fact, NSEL had filed its reply to the SCN issued by DCA.
45,F1524824031964_S46,Material Fact, In the event of NSEL failing to file a satisfactory explanation DCA would withdraw the exemption granted vide notification dated June 5 2007 without any further communication.
46,F1524824031964_S47,Subjective Observation,In my view a reader of the newspaper article dated October 3 2012 containing the information noted above could have deduced the implications of the SCN dated April 27 2012 to a lesser or greater extent depending on his her exposure to the subject matter covered in the newspaper article.
47,F1524824031964_S48,subjective observation,In my view the newspaper article was not speculative in nature as it published precise facts relating to the issuance of SCN and also brought out specific contents of the SCN summarizing the allegations levelled against NSEL and the possible consequences thereof.
48,F1524824031964_S49,Material Fact,The article categorically mentioned that failure on part of NSEL to provide a satisfactory explanation to the allegations levelled in the SCN would result in withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide notification dated June 5 2007.
49,F1524824031964_S50,Material Fact,The said withdrawal of exemption in turn would have had a cascading effect on the contracts being traded on NSEL payment defaults in relation thereto and the eventual loss to the reputation of the promoters management of NSEL.
50,F1524824031964_S51,subjective observation,Considering the above I find that the price sensitive information relating to the implication of the SCN dated April 27 2012 became public from the time when the article relating to the SCN dated April 27 2012 appeared in Economic Times on October 3 2012 and as such ceased to be UPSI from that date.
51,F1524824031964_S52,Subjective Observation,Accordingly the period during which the period the UPSI existed Adjudication Order in respect of Dilip Tambe in the matter of MCX was from the issuance of the SCN to its publication i.e  from April 27 2012 to October 3 2012.”
52,F1524824031964_S53,subjective observation,I note that in the said order WTM inter alia held that since those individuals Noticee did not trade in the shares of MCX when in possession of UPSI the violation of regulation 3i of the PIT Regulations 1992 cannot be established against them.
53,F1524824031964_S54,subjective observation,I have also gone through the charges leveled against the Noticee in the SCN which have arisen out of the same set of facts identical to that of in the WTM Order and I do not find any reason to disagree with the view taken by the WTM about the periodicity of UPSI i.e  from April 27 2012 to October 3 2012.
54,F1524824031964_S55,subjective observation,Since there was no UPSI in existence at the time of sale of 875 shares of MCX on May 22 2013 by the Noticee therefore I am inclined to conclude that violation of Regulation 3i of the PIT Regulations 1992 by the Noticee as alleged in the SCN dated December 14 2017 do not stand established.
55,F1524824031964_S56,subjective observation,Since the alleged violation is not established against the Noticee Issue No 2 requires no consideration.
56,F1524824031964_S57,others,ORDER 15.
57,F1524824031964_S58,Subjective Observation,For the aforesaid reasons Show Cause Notice EAD AO PM AA OW 31600 2017 dated December 14 2017 alleging violations of provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Regulation 122 of PIT Regulations 2015 by the Noticee i.e  Shri Dilip Tambe is disposed of without imposition of any penalty.
58,F1524824031964_S59,procedural fact,In terms of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copies of this order are sent to Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
