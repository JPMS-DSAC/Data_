57,F1530099079223_S58,Subjective Observation,With regard to status of legal heirs it is a settled position that the property of the deceased member vests in the legal members of the deceased and transmission of shares to legal heirs of deceased shareholder is not a voluntary act as in case of transfer of shares.
58,F1530099079223_S59,Related Fact,As held by the Company Law Board in the matter of S. Kanthimathy S. Lakshmi S. vs  The Woodlands Estates Limited decided on 20 August 2007 2008 144 Comp Cases 830 CLB 2008 83 SCL 491 CLB when a shareholder dies his legal representatives represent the estate of that shareholder and that when a member dies his estate is entrusted in the legal representatives.

62,F1530099079223_S63,Related Fact,In Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi’s case the Adjudicating Officer of SEBI had imposed monetary penalty upon Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi for making delayed disclosures about her acquisition of shares in Rajoo Engineers Ltd by way of transmission of shares from her husband since deceased.
63,F1530099079223_S64,Related Fact,In appeal filed by the said Devyani Chandrakant Doshi Hon’ble SAT remanded back the matter to the Adjudicating Officer who later by an order dated March 24 2015 held that the charge against said Devyani Chandrakant Doshi was not established and exonerated her.
64,F1530099079223_S65,Related Fact,Further by an order dated December 28 2017 passed by another Adjudicating Officer in the matter of Sanwaria Agro Oils Ltd it was concluded that nondisclosure of acquisition by way of transmission of shares sans any voluntary act on the part of promoter was not a fit case for imposition of monetary penalty and exonerated the concerned promoter from the charges levelled against her.
65,F1530099079223_S66,others,Adjudication Order in respect of Jay Ushin Limited Ref No.
66,F1530099079223_S67,others,EAD2 SS SK 12 201819 10.

68,F1530099079223_S69,subjective observation,There was no change in the promoter shareholding per se and acquisition was by way of operation of law as opposed to any voluntary act of acquisition on the part of JPM.
69,F1530099079223_S70,subjective observation,In the facts and circumstances of this case the act of the Noticee cannot be said to be blameworthy and in my view the charge is technical and venial.
70,F1530099079223_S71,subjective observation,Considering the aforesaid principles of law endorsed by Hon’ble SAT I am of the view that the present case also would not be a fit case for imposition of section 15A b of the SEBI Act.
71,F1530099079223_S72,subjective observation,In view of the above I conclude that the case does not warrant imposition of any monetary penalty and exonerate Jay Ushin Limited from the charges levelled against it in the SCN.
72,F1530099079223_S73,Procedural Fact,The SCN is disposed of accordingly.
