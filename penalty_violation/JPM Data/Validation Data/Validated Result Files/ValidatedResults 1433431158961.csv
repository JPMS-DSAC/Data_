137,F1433431158961_S138,Defendant Claim,Noticee has stated that the terms of Clause 36 are clear that the management of the Company takes three calls firstly on likely outcome of the matter secondly on its financial impact and finally on the fact as to whether the same would cause a material impact on the operations and financials of the company.
138,F1433431158961_S139,Defendant Claim,This conclusively establishes that the disclosure requirement is subjective qualitative and is neither based on mere existence of the litigation nor is it a quantitative value based disclosure.
139,F1433431158961_S140,Defendant Claim,This is also corroborated by a reference the heading which talks of disclosure being contingent on the Adjudication in the matter of M s.
140,F1433431158961_S141,Defendant Claim,New Delhi Television Limited litigation dispute regulatory action having a material impact and not merely on the basis of the existence of such a litigation.
141,F1433431158961_S142,subjective observation,Accordingly in light of the above it becomes abundantly clear that the disclosure requirements for litigation disputes as intended under the Listing Agreement are limited to litigation disputes which can be reasonably expected to have a material impact.
142,F1433431158961_S143,Subjective Observation,Before going to examine the case it may be noted that since the materiality has not been defined categorically it has to be determined on a case to case basis depending upon the various facts specific to the case and circumstances relating to the case.

146,F1433431158961_S147,Related Fact,In my view the test to determine whether a fact is ‘material’ depends upon facts and circumstances of each case” 21.
147,F1433431158961_S148,Subjective Observation,Materiality can be determined either based on quantitative parameters or based on qualitative parameters.
148,F1433431158961_S149,Subjective Observation,The quantitative parameters are linked to the financials of the entity whereas qualitative parameters are to be linked to the likely impact of the non disclosure on the market as also the decision making process of the investors.
149,F1433431158961_S150,statutory fact,Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement clearly sets out the objectives of the clause a. to enable the shareholders and the public to appraise the position of the Company and b. to avoid the establishment of a false market in its securities.
150,F1433431158961_S151,statutory fact,The guidance Note of BSE as well states that the Listed entity may consider the impact of such disclosure on legal court proceedings while making the disclosures and make the disclosure accordingly.

157,F1433431158961_S158,subjective observation,I note that from bare and combined perusal of aforesaid Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement and Para 6 of Guidance Note  it is very much clear that in case of litigation dispute with a material impact the disclosure is warranted on a prompt and immediate basis which may also include not only the details of the event but also the impact of the event as envisaged by the management of the company.
158,F1433431158961_S159,Subjective Observation,The said disclosure is aimed at enabling the shareholders and the public to appraise the position of the company.
159,F1433431158961_S160,subjective observation,Therefore the reliance placed by the Noticee only on part of the Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement and the Para 6 of the BSE Guidance Note cannot be ignored over the other parts of the same Clause Para.

184,F1433431158961_S185,defendant claim,The Noticee submitted that immediately upon receipt of the Assessment Order it approached its legal and tax advisor who is the tax counsel specialising in tax litigation.
185,F1433431158961_S186,defendant claim,It immediately obtained oral advice from its advisor according to whom the demand in the assessment order was high pitched and based on an erroneous view taken by the Income Tax Department.
186,F1433431158961_S187,Defendant Claim,The tax advisor further advised that the Noticee should immediately file an Adjudication in the matter of M s.
187,F1433431158961_S188,defendant claim,New Delhi Television Limited appeal against the alleged demand before the ITAT in which there would be a high probability of the alleged demand being dismissed.
188,F1433431158961_S189,defendant claim,It was also submitted that the Company immediately acted upon the advice obtained by it and filed an appeal before the ITAT on March 4 2014.
189,F1433431158961_S190,defendant claim,The tax advisor who gave the advice to the Company was himself involved in settling the appeal and argued the Company’s case before the ITAT.
190,F1433431158961_S191,subjective observation,This clearly shows that the professional advisor not only advised the Company but also acted for the Company in furtherance of such advice.
191,F1433431158961_S192,material fact,The Hon’ble ITAT vide its orders dated March 26 2014 and April 21 2014 granted an interim stay on recovery of the alleged demand on payment of a sum of Rs 5 Crores which is 1.2% approximate of the alleged Tax Demand.
192,F1433431158961_S193,defendant claim,The Noticee has claimed that therefore the advice in fact translated into reality in as much as a stay was granted by the ITAT on recovery of the Tax Demand.
193,F1433431158961_S194,subjective observation,The details of other ITAT Orders provided by the Noticee are not sufficient enough to draw any meaningful inference.
194,F1433431158961_S195,Defendant Claim,Additionally based on the oral advice of reputed senior counsels and the proposed appeal PresidentCorporate Planning and Operations and Executive ViceChairperson of the Company discussed the matter with the management team of the Company to consider whether any disclosure was required to be made for the alleged Tax Demand.
195,F1433431158961_S196,Defendant Claim,The Company based on the advice of a reputed senior tax counsel came to an informed and diligent view that disclosure of the Assessment Order was not warranted as it would not have a material impact on the Noticee.
196,F1433431158961_S197,Defendant Claim,The alleged Tax Demand’s disclosure in isolation would in fact give an incorrect and incomplete picture to the investors and mislead the investors thereby creating a false market for the scrip.
197,F1433431158961_S198,Defendant Claim,Such a disclosure would also therefore be against the spirit of the Listing Agreement as it would lead to an incomplete representation of the matter to the shareholders as it would be a disclosure of litigation without a material impact.

199,F1433431158961_S200,Others,New Delhi Television Limited 26.
200,F1433431158961_S201,Subjective Observation,It is pertinent to mention here that the guidance note of BSE on clause 36 of the listing agreement states as to who in a listed entity has the Authority for making disclosures.
201,F1433431158961_S202,statutory fact,The same is as below  Para A Every Listed Entity shall have a policy determining the authority within the entity that is entitled to take a view on the materiality of an event that qualifies for disclosure under Clause 36 to decide the appropriate time at which such disclosure is to be filed with Exchange and details that may be filed in the best interest of present and potential investors.
202,F1433431158961_S203,statutory fact,The authority could be Board of Directors or CEO or an operating committee of Senior Level Executives or Key Managerial Personnel as defined under Companies Act 2013 etc. as decided by the management of the Listed Entity.
203,F1433431158961_S204,Material Fact,It may be noted that the onus of ensuring that the information disclosed to the Exchange is duly authorized to be disclosed as such lies with the listed entity only and the Exchange shall assume that any disclosure received has been duly authorized.
204,F1433431158961_S205,Procedural Fact,During the course of the first hearing the details of the decision making process by the noticee w.r.t. the said disclosure was sought with supporting evidence.
205,F1433431158961_S206,defendant claim,The Company stated that in addition to what is stated already all the matters which have a bearing under Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement are discussed by the respective Head of the Departments with management team of the Company which depending upon the facts and circumstances takes legal professional opinion and then decide on the future course of action.
206,F1433431158961_S207,subjective observation,Thus it is noted that at the time when the disclosure obligation arose i.e  immediately upon the receipt of the Assessment Order in terms of the Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement the Noticee did not furnish sufficient evidence that the opinion of the tax adviser existed at the time when the disclosure obligation arose.
207,F1433431158961_S208,subjective observation,It also did not furnish the record of discussions decisions by the relevant authority within the Company as regards the materiality.
208,F1433431158961_S209,Others,Adjudication in the matter of M s.
209,F1433431158961_S210,material fact,New Delhi Television Limited The disputed amount of Rs 450 crores in the tax demand is noted to be significant when compared with Rs 349.77 crores of revenue of Noticee for the year ended March 31 2014 as also the networth of Rs 365 Crores. as on March 31 2014 .
210,F1433431158961_S211,material fact,The company has consistently posted a net loss for the past five years.
211,F1433431158961_S212,material fact,The net loss in FY 2014 amounts to Rs 53.56crores.
212,F1433431158961_S213,subjective observation,In view above Noticee should have made voluntary disclosures to stock exchanges on an immediate and prompt basis.
213,F1433431158961_S214,subjective observation,Although it is the prerogative of companies to decide on materiality in this case the amount is material particularly considering the financials of the Company and information ought to have been disclosed.
214,F1433431158961_S215,material fact,It is noted that the amount involved in the income tax demand was larger than the revenue of the company and significantly larger than its net profit i.e  net loss in the recent financial year as also greater than its net worth.
215,F1433431158961_S216,defendant claim,The Noticee has stated that the view taken by the Company after consulting legal tax advisors was also accepted by the Independent Auditors of the Company.
216,F1433431158961_S217,Subjective Observation,The Auditors needed to take a position on whether or not the tax demand needed to be considered as a contingent liability in terns of AS29 which is mandatory.
217,F1433431158961_S218,statutory fact,Paragraph 27 of the Accounting Standards 29 states “A contingent liability is disclosed as required by paragraph 68 unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.”
218,F1433431158961_S219,Material Fact,The Auditors while finalising the accounts based on their independent analysis and also taking into account the opinion of the tax advisors concluded that the alleged demand was neither a contingent liability in the books of the Company nor did they consider it necessary to qualify the report in this regard.
219,F1433431158961_S220,Subjective Observation,Hence the view of the auditors was also to treat the said demand as remote and not a material liability which either required to be included as a contingent liability or required any qualification in the report.
220,F1433431158961_S221,Others,Adjudication in the matter of M s.
221,F1433431158961_S222,material fact,New Delhi Television Limited However the auditors opinion was not available at the time when the disclosure obligation arose i.e  immediately after the receipt of the Assessment order.
222,F1433431158961_S223,material fact,It is also to be noted that the amount of the Tax Demand was significant compared to the financials of the Company.
223,F1433431158961_S224,subjective observation,Further it was an Assessment Order issued by the relevant Statutory Authority after the Noticee provided all the documents and confirmations required by the Assessing Officer and therefore probability of the decision going against the Noticee cannot be entirely ruled out.
224,F1433431158961_S225,defendant claim,Noticee has further stated that the acts of the Company were at all times bonafide and there was no concealment of information by the Company.
225,F1433431158961_S226,Defendant Claim,It is stated that the information in relation to the Tax Demand was disclosed in the Annual Report and the Financial Statements of the Company.
226,F1433431158961_S227,subjective observation,However I find that the same was made available much after the time when the disclosure obligation arose i.e  immediately after the receipt of the Assessment Order.
227,F1433431158961_S228,defendant claim,Noticee has further stated that the Company promptly disclosed the same to the Stock Exchanges upon request though it continued to maintain that in light of the above the same was not material information and as such did not merit a disclosure.
228,F1433431158961_S229,subjective observation,On a careful reading of Clause 36 I find that the involuntary disclosure which was much later that too at the instance of stock exchanges is in compliance of only the additional obligation cast by the Clause 36 and cannot be in lieu of the obligation of voluntary disclosure on a prompt and immediate basis.
229,F1433431158961_S230,Defendant Claim,Noticee has stated that on May 29 2014 the information update provided by the Company was made available on the stock exchanges as well.
230,F1433431158961_S231,Defendant Claim,The price movement of the shares of the Company thereafter was brought to the notice.
231,F1433431158961_S232,defendant claim,Noticee submitted that the fact that the disclosure of the information had no material impact on the price of shares of the Company upon disclosure is irrefutable evidence of the fact and confirmation of the company’s view that the said information was neither price sensitive nor material on the basis of which or which could have impacted the decision of the investors potential investors to buy sell the shares of the Company.
232,F1433431158961_S233,defendant claim,Hence it is submitted that this information was not material as it Adjudication in the matter of M s.
233,F1433431158961_S234,defendant claim,New Delhi Television Limited did not contribute in any way to the investors’ decision invest or exit the Company.
234,F1433431158961_S235,Material Fact,In this regard it may be noted that the information disclosed on May 29 2014 not only contained the details of the Tax Demand and the advice of the tax advisor but also of the fact that stay has been granted for the operation of the Order which was a subsequent development not existing at the time when the disclosure obligation arose.
235,F1433431158961_S236,Subjective Observation,Hence no inference can be drawn that this information was not material as it did not contribute in any way to the investors’ decision invest or exit the Company.
236,F1433431158961_S237,subjective observation,I have noted that the investors have not raised any kind of grievance regarding any alleged wrong or inadequate disclosure except for one complainant who has had past professional association with the company.
237,F1433431158961_S238,Related Fact,I refer to the decision of the Honble Securities Appellate Tribumal SAT in the matter of Komal Nahata Vs.
238,F1433431158961_S239,Related Fact,SEBI Date of judgment January 27 2014 has observed that “Argument that no investor has suffered on account of non disclosure and that the AO has not considered the mitigating factors set out under Section 15J of SEBI Act 1992 is without any merit because firstly penalty for non compliance of SAST Regulations 1997 and PIT Regulations 1992 is not dependent upon the investors actually suffering on account of such non disclosure.”
239,F1433431158961_S240,Related Fact,I also note that in Appeal No 78 of 2014 of Akriti Global Traders Ltd Vs.

Argument of appellant that the delay was unintentional and that the appellant has not gained from such delay and therefore penalty ought not to have been imposed is without any merit because firstly penal liability arises as soon as provisions under the regulations are violated and that penal liability is neither dependent upon intention of parties nor gains accrued from such delay.”

242,F1433431158961_S243,subjective observation,New Delhi Television Limited In view of the same the argument put forth by the Noticee that no gain or advantage leave alone disproportionate gain or unfair advantage had accrued to the company or no loss to the shareholders investors is not relevant for the given case.
243,F1433431158961_S244,Defendant Claim,The Noticee has stated that the ITAT had granted a stay on recovery of the tax demand on payment of Rs 5 Crores only.
244,F1433431158961_S245,Defendant Claim,Due to the statutory limitation on the power of the ITAT to grant stay only for a period of one year i.e  till 25 th March 2015 the Company approached the Hon’ble Delhi High Court seeking further stay on the alleged Tax Demand which has been granted.
245,F1433431158961_S246,defendant claim,This was required as department had sought adjournments in the matter due to which the hearing could not be completed in due time and for no fault of the Company.
246,F1433431158961_S247,Defendant Claim,Accordingly the Company filed a Writ Petition before the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi on March 21 2015 for extension of stay being WPC 2992 of 2015.
247,F1433431158961_S248,Defendant Claim,The above mentioned writ petition came up for hearing on March 24 2015.
248,F1433431158961_S249,Defendant Claim,The Hon’ble Court was pleased to continue the stay of recovery operating in favour of the Company on the same terms till the final disposal of the appeal by the ITAT.
249,F1433431158961_S250,Defendant Claim,The Hon’ble Court further directed the ITAT to dispose of the appeal filed by the Company expeditiously.
250,F1433431158961_S251,Defendant Claim,The Hon’ble High Court disposed off the Writ Petition in the above terms.
251,F1433431158961_S252,Defendant Claim,According to the Noticee this further shows that even the Hon’ble Delhi High Court primafacie agreed with the case of the Company in granting a stay on the alleged Tax Demand.
252,F1433431158961_S253,material fact,It is noted that the company has filed an appeal before ITAT.
253,F1433431158961_S254,Subjective Observation,It is pertinent to note that the operation of the Order has been stayed by the Honble High Court.
254,F1433431158961_S255,subjective observation,The Order has not been set aside.

256,F1433431158961_S257,statutory fact,In terms of para 7ii of the guidance note of BSE disclosure has been prescribed periodically till the litigation is concluded or dispute is resolved.
257,F1433431158961_S258,subjective observation,The subsequent developments cannot be viewed to be having any bearing on the disclosure obligation as and when it arose.

264,F1433431158961_S266,subjective observation,Further the SAT decision does not absolve the Company entirely.
265,F1433431158961_S267,Related Fact,As regards DLF Limited v.
266,F1433431158961_S268,related fact,SEBI Appeal No 331 of 2014 SAT Order dated 13.03.2015 “The Materiality envisaged in the DIP Guidelines relates to adequacy and not the arithmetic accuracy of material facts necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete opinion by prospective investors to invest or not to invest in the IPO.
267,F1433431158961_S269,Related Fact,Disclosure in the larger scheme of DIP Guidelines which is required to be made in the Offer Documents is one which if concealed would have a devastating effect on the decision making process of the investors and without which the investors could not have formed a rational and fair business decision of investment in the IPO.”

271,F1433431158961_S273,Related Fact,In my view the test to determine whether a fact is ‘material’ depends upon facts and circumstances of each case”.
272,F1433431158961_S274,Subjective Observation,I have relied upon the said case laws.
273,F1433431158961_S275,material fact,However as brought out earlier it may be noted that the information disclosed on May 29 2014 not only contained the details of the Tax Demand and the advice of the tax advisor but also of the fact that stay has been granted for the operation of the Order which was a subsequent development not existing at the time of requisite disclosure obligation.
274,F1433431158961_S276,Subjective Observation,Hence no inference can be drawn that this information was not material as it did not contribute in any way to the investors’ decision invest or exit the Company.
275,F1433431158961_S277,related fact,As regards the case of Hindustan Steel vs State of Orissa as cited by the Noticee reliance is also placed in certain decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court Hindustan Steel Ltd v.

279,F1433431158961_S281,related fact,Even if a minimum penalty is prescribed the authority competent to impose the penalty will be justified in refusing to impose penalty when there is a technical or venial breach of the provisions of the Act or where the breach flows from a bona fide belief that the offender is not liable to act in the manner prescribed by the statute.
280,F1433431158961_S282,related fact,Those in charge of the affairs of the Company in failing to register the Adjudication in the matter of M s.

283,F1433431158961_S285,Defendant Claim,In light of the express provisions of section 23 J of the SCRA as well as the express findings of the Hon’ble Supreme Court as cited above it is submitted by the Noticee that in the present case even if the Company is found to be in a violation of the disclosure obligations under the Listing Agreement the same does not warrant an imposition of penalty.
284,F1433431158961_S286,Defendant Claim,The same is in light of the circumstances as stated above which clearly demonstrate that the Company acted in a bonafide manner and the breach if any was at best a technical or venial breach borne out of a genuine belief that the Company was acting in compliance of the requirements of Clause 36.
285,F1433431158961_S287,subjective observation,As brought out earlier the noticee has failed to furnish the evidence in support of the existence of legal advice at the time when the disclosure obligation arose as also the decision making regarding the materiality of the information which would have formed the basis of the honest and genuine belief of the company that it was acting in compliance of clause 36.
286,F1433431158961_S288,related fact,Further The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs.
287,F1433431158961_S289,related fact,Shri Ram Mutual Fund SCL 216SC held that “In our considered opinion penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established and hence the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes wholly irrelevant ...

297,F1433431158961_S300,Subjective Observation,In view of the charges as established the facts and circumstances of the case and the judgments referred to and mentioned hereinabove the quantum of penalty would depend on the factors referred in Section 23J of SEBI Act and stated as above.
298,F1433431158961_S301,Subjective Observation,The main objective of clause 36 of the listing agreement is disclosure of material information as and when it occurs along with the assessment of impact as envisaged in the Guidance Note of BSE to the Clause 36.
299,F1433431158961_S302,Subjective Observation,The said clause seeks to achieve fair treatment by inter alia mandating disclosure of timely and adequate information to enable shareholders to make an informed decision and ensuring that there is a fair and informed market in the shares of companies affected.
300,F1433431158961_S303,subjective observation,Correct and timely disclosures are also an essential part of the proper functioning of the securities market and failure to do so results in preventing investors from taking wellinformed decisions Thus the cornerstone of the clause is investor protection.
301,F1433431158961_S304,subjective observation,It is noted that no quantifiable figures are available to assess the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made as a result of such noncompliance by the Noticee.
302,F1433431158961_S305,subjective observation,Further from the material available on record it is not possible to ascertain the exact monetary loss to the investors on account of noncompliance by the Noticee.
