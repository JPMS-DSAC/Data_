The daily average volume traded during the period under investigation increased significantly i.e. by around 295% from the daily average volume traded for the preceding two months of the investigation period. This average daily volume remained so for two months following the investigation period as well. Adjudication Order in respect of Vikas Narnavar in the matter of Genus Commu Trade Limited June 10, 2010 Order No MC AO- 02 2010 5. During the investigation period, it was observed that four brokers namely, Adolf Pinto, Vijaya Bhagwandas & Co, DPS Shares and Securities and Pawan J. Chaudhary indulged in circular trading among themselves. 6. The aforesaid brokers dealing on own account and for respective clients purchased 20,83,551 shares and sold 22,45,146 shares which constitutes 12.72% and 13.71% of the gross volume traded respectively during the relevant period. These brokers and some of their clients entered into circular trading for among themselves for 19,46,396 shares, which accounted for 93% of their total purchase and 86.69% of their total sale. 7. Vikas Gaurihar Narnavar (hereinafter referred to as Vikas Narnavar) has traded through M S Adolf Pinto and Pilot Credit Capital Ltd Vikas Narnavar purchased 35,000 shares and sold 90,000 shares in the market through Pilot Credit Capital Ltd., purchased 2,89,350 shares and sold 41,43,45 shares in the market through Adolf Pinto, and received 60,000 shares in off market transactions. 8.

However, the volume of trading was significantly higher in the Adjudication Order in respect of Vikas Narnavar in the matter of Genus Commu Trade Limited June 10, 2010 Order No MC AO- 02 2010 investigation period at an average of 3.48 lac shares per day, which was 295% higher than the average daily volume of around 88,488 shares in the preceding two months. 19. The investigation has brought out that a significant part of this volume was artificially generated by the orders entered by Vikas Narnavar. Of the 6,85,497 shares traded by Vikas Narnavar on gross basis (2.09% of gross volume traded), 5,68,750 were through circular constituting 1.74% to total volume traded during the investigation period. 20. The same numbers of share was rotated in a circular manner among the members in the group on daily basis so that the same numbers of share goes back to the original seller at the end of the day and net position of each member remains nil, without resulting in any change in beneficial ownership of the shares traded. Thus there was no intent to buy or sell shares and the only intention was to create artificial volumes so as to give an impression of buying interest in the scrip. 21. The trading by Vikas Narnavar thus contributed to creation of artificial volumes to create an impression of active trading interest in the scrip and to thus attract unsuspecting investors to invest in the scrip. 22. However, based on the submissions made by Vikas Narnavar regarding his occupation and income, I find it difficult to believe that the trades were actually undertaken by Vikas Narnavar. Taking into consideration the affidavit submitted by Ramnik Lal Patel, I find that Vikas Narnavar was merely instrumental in lending his identity to Ramniklal Patel. It was in effect Ramnik Lal Patel who indulged in circular and synchronized trades to give misleading appearance of trading in the scrip of GCL. I note that the investigation report brought out that Ramnik Lal Patel received 14,50,000 shares from two other clients, namely Dhirubhai Sukkarbhai Nakia and Ramesh Sukkarbhai Talaviya in off-market transactions and off-loaded them in the market. 23. Regulation 4(1) of PFUTP Rgulations prohibits persons from indulging in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities. Regulation 4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, inter alia, prohibits a person from indulging in an act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market. Regulation 4(2) (g) of PFUTP Regulations prohibits a person from entering into a transaction in securities without intention of performing it or without intention of change of ownership of such security. 24. While I am convinced that the trades executed in the name of Vikas Narnavar were No actually executed by him, I find that he did aid the process of manipulation by lending his identity to the actual perpetrator. I thus find that Vikas Narnavar contributed indirectly to the misleading appearance of trading in the shares of GCL. In view of the foregoing, I hold that the allegation of violation of provisions of Regulations 4(1) of PFUTP Regulations stand established. Adjudication Order in respect of Vikas Narnavar in the matter of Genus Commu Trade Limited June 10, 2010 Order No MC AO- 02 2010 Issue 2: Whether the noticee is liable for monetary penalty under sections 15 HA of the Act? 25. As the allegations against the noticee stand established, he is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15 HA of the SEBI Act, 1992, which read as follows: “Penalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices. 15HA. If any person indulges in fraudulent and unfair trade practices relating to securities, he shall be liable to a penalty of twenty-five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of such practices, whichever is higher.” ISSUE 3: What quantum of monetary penalty should be imposed on the noticee, taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of SEBI Act? 26. While deciding the quantum of penalty, the factors laid down under Section 15J of SEBI Act have to be given due regard, which are as follows – (i) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of default, (ii) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default and (iii) the repetitive nature of default. 27. From the material available on record, it is difficult to quantify exactly the disproportionate gains or unfair advantage enjoyed by an entity and the consequent losses suffered by the investors. The investigation report also does No dwell on the extent of specific gains made by the noticee. While imposing monetary penalty, I have taken into account the fact that the notice has violated the provisions of Regulations 4(1) of PFUTP Regulations by lending his identity in return for minor pecuniary gain. I have also taken into account the submissions made by the notice regarding his sources of income. 28. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the material available on record and the violation committed by the noticee, I find that penalty of Rs. 15,000 -(Rs. Fifteen thousand) under Section 15 HA of the SEBI Act will be commensurate with the violations committed by the noticee. Adjudication Order in respect of Vikas Narnavar in the matter of Genus Commu Trade Limited June 10, 2010 Order No MC AO- 02 2010 ORDER 29. After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, I hereby impose a penalty of Rs. 15,000 -(Rs. Fifteen Thousand only) under Section 15 HA SEBI Act on the noticee, Vikas Gourihar Narnavar for violation of Regulations 4(1) of PFUTP Regulations . 30. The noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India”, payable at Mumbai, within 45 days of receipt of this order. The said demand draft should be forwarded to Mr. G Ramar, General Manager, SEBI, SEBI Bhavan, C4-A, ‘G’ Block, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra (East). Mumbai- 400 051. 31. In terms of rule 6 of the Rules, copies of this order are sent to the noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

B. Welkar Street, Chira Bazar, Mumbai – 400 002 FACTS OF THE CASE IN BRIEF 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as “SEBI”) conducted an investigation in the scrip of Systel Infotech Ltd (hereinafter referred to as “SIL”) on the basis of an investigation conducted by Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (hereinafter referred to as “BSE”) for the period from 31st December 2004 to 15th April 2005. BSE in its observations revealed that Promoters were the major sellers who sold 4,75,000 shares at an average rate of Rs. 23 per share, through the stock broker Renaissance Securities Ltd Shri Jitendranath Alluri, sold 4,00,000 shares through the stock broker Renaissance Securities Ltd and Ms. Rajeshwari Alluri sold 75,000 shares also through the stock broker Renaissance Securities Ltd 2. Based on the above facts, investigation was initiated by SEBI, relating to buying, selling or dealing in the shares of the company. The period from December 31, 2004 to April 15, 2005 has been taken up as period of investigation. From the shareholding pattern available on BSE website it was observed that promoters held 16,76,030 shares (52.38%) as on December 31, 2004 which decreased by 4,00,000 shares to 12,76,030 shares (39.88%) as on quarter ending March 31, 2005. 3. As noted from the IR that during the period (December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005) Shri Jitendranath Alluri one of the promoters reduced his shareholding by 4,00,000 shares from 4,48,640 shares (14.02%) as on December 31, 2004 to 48,640 shares (1.52%) as on March 31, 2005. The aforesaid sale of 4,00,000 shares representing 12.5% of the equity share capital of the company in the month of February 2005. Further it is noted from the IR and demat statements that during the period (December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005) Ms. Rajeshwari Alluri another promoter reduced her shareholding by 75,000 shares from 4,09,100 shares (12.78%) as on December 31, 2004 to 3,34,100 shares (10.44%) as on March 31, 2005. 4. The aforesaid sale of 4,00,000 & 75,000 shares respectively by the promoter group representing 12.5 % & 2.34% of the equity share capital of the company and on the basis of information furnished by BSE it is alleged that Systel Infotech Ltd (hereinafter referred to as “noticee SIL”) has failed to file disclosures to BSE, for the sale of 4,75,000 shares by its promoters as mentioned above. 5. Thus it is alleged that Systel Infotech Limited (hereinafter referred to as ‘the noticee’) has failed to file necessary disclosures as required under Regulation 13 (6) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as ‘PIT Regulations’) and Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as ‘SAST Regulations’). APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER. 6. I was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer under section 15 I of SEBI Act, read with Rule 3 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as ‘Rules’) to inquire into and adjudge under Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act, the violations of Regulation 13 (6) of the SEBI PIT Regulations and Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI SAST Regulations. SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, HEARING AND REPLY 7. A show cause notice A&E DRK MD 171532 2009 dated July 30, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as ‘SCN’) was issued to the noticee in terms of Rule 4 of the Rules seeking reply as to why an inquiry should No be held against it for failure to comply with the disclosure requirements enumerated under the provisions of Regulation 13 (6) of the SEBI PIT Regulations and Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI SAST Regulations, alleged to have been committed by the noticee. 8. The aforesaid SCN was sent at two addresses, one as available on the BSE website and the second at the address shown on the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs by “Hand Delivery Acknowledgement Due”. The noticee received the SCN sent to the BSE address. Proof of delivery of the aforesaid SCN is on record. However the noticee failed to reply to the aforesaid SCN. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it has been decided to conduct an inquiry in the matter and an opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the noticee on December 16, 2009 vide hearing notice dated November 18, 2009. In the aforesaid hearing notice, noticee was again given an opportunity to submit its reply to the SCN latest by November 30, 2009. The hearing notice was sent by “Hand Delivery Acknowledgement Due”. The aforesaid hearing notice returned undelivered with a remark “Letter No accepted”. Following the refusal by the noticee to accept the hearing noticee an attempt was made to serve the same through Fax on the number available on the BSE Website. The hearing notice could No be served and the fax generated an error report with a remark “Busy No signal”. Subsequently in terms of Rule 7 (C) of Adjudication Rules the hearing notice was affixed on the address at which SCN was delivered which happens to be the same address as available on the BSE Website. 9. The noticee neither submitted any reply to SCN No attended the personal hearing scheduled on December 16, 2009 without furnishing any reason. In the interest of natural justice, noticee was given another opportunity of personal hearing on December 31, 2009 vide final hearing notice dated December 16, 2009 and again time was granted to submit its reply latest by December 24, 2009. This hearing notice was also sent by “Hand Delivery Acknowledgement Due” and the same was returned undelivered with a remark “Office Shifted”. However the final hearing notice was also affixed in terms of Rule 7 (C) of Adjudication rules at the available address as per BSE website. The noticee again failed to reply to the SCN and attend the personal hearing without furnishing any reason. In this scenario, I am compelled to pass an ex-parte order against the noticee based on the materials made available on record. CONSIDERATION OF EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS 10. The allegation against the noticee is that it had violated Regulation 13 (6) of the SEBI PIT Regulations and Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI SAST Regulations. The text of these regulations are as follows:- Regulation 13 (6) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 Disclosure of interest or holding by directors and officers and substantial shareholders in a listed companies - Initial Disclosure. 13. (1) ………. (2) ……...... Continual disclosure. (3)……….. (4) ………. (5) ………. Disclosure by company to stock exchanges. (6) Every listed company, within five days of receipt, shall disclose to all stock exchanges on which the company is listed, the information received under sub-regulations (1), (2), (3) and (4) in the respective formats specified in Schedule III. Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI SAST Regulations Continual disclosures. 8. (1) …….. (2) …….. (3) Every company whose shares are listed on a stock exchange, shall within 30 days from the financial year ending March 31, as well as the record date of the company for the purposes of declaration of dividend, make yearly disclosures to all the stock exchanges on which the shares of the company are listed, the changes, if any, in respect of the holdings of the persons referred to under sub-regulation (1) and also holdings of promoters or person(s) having control over the company as on 31st March. 11 a) It is noted from IR that Shri Jitendranath Alluri was holding 4,48,640 shares of SIL amounting to 14.02 % of the equity capital of SIL as on December 31, 2004. It is further noted from IR that as on March 31, 2005 the number of shares held by him decreased by 4,00,000 i.e. from 4,48,640 shares to 48,640 shares. Thus Shri Jitendranath Alluri sold 4,00,000 shares ( 2 lakh shares each of 16th and 25th February, 2005) representing 12.5% of the equity capital of the company in the month of February 2005. b) Further it is noted from IR that Ms. Rajeshwari Alluri was holding 4,09,100 shares of SIL amounting to 12.78 % of the equity capital of SIL as on December 31, 2004. It is further noted from IR that as on March 31, 2005 the number of shares held by Ms. Rajeshwari Alluri decreased by 75,000 i.e. from 4,09,100 shares to 3,34,100 shares. Thus Ms. Rajeshwari Alluri sold 75,000 shares on 9th March, 2005 representing 2.34% of the equity capital of the company as on December 31, 2004. 12 a) It is further noted from the IR that noticee Systel Infotech Limited has No submitted disclosures under SEBI PIT Regulations and SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997 during the period from December 31, 2004 to April 15, 2005. In this regard I have noted that noticee i.e. Systel Infotech Limited vide its letters dated 21st February, 2005 and 28th February, 2005 informed BSE that shri Jitendranath Alluri one of the promoters, sold 2,00,000 shares each on two occasions through off market deals in the month of February 2005, which was also acknowledged by BSE on February 21st 2005 and March 1st 2005 respectively. The copy of the aforesaid letters is on record. So from the aforesaid letters it can be concluded that the noticee had informed about the sale of 4,00,000 shares by shri Jitendranath Alluri to BSE as per PIT Regulations. b) With regard to sale of 75,000 shares of SIL by the other promoter Ms. Rajeshwari Alluri, from the available records it can be concluded that noticee failed to inform BSE about the sale of shares as required under Regulation 13 (6) of the SEBI PIT Regulations and Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI SAST Regulations. 13 Further on the basis of the investigation certain discrepancy was observed in the shareholding of Jitendranath Alluri and Rajeshwari Alluri the promoters of SIL. As per the information available with BSE, Jitendranath Alluri had 4,48,640 shares of SIL as on December 31, 2004 and he sold 4,00,000 shares in the month of February 2005 and thus he was left with 48,640 shares of SIL. As per the information available with Registrar and Share Transfer Agent and demat statement available on record, it is established that Jitendranath Alluri had 4,09,200 shares of SIL as on December 31,2004 and he sold 4,00,000 shares in the month of February 2005 and thus he was left with 9,200 shares of SIL. So it can be concluded that notice had submitted wrong disclosures to BSE with regard to the promoters shareholding and subsequent changes therein. 14 It is alleged in the IR that clarification was sought from the company on the shareholding of the promoters and the changes therein but the company noticee did No respond to SEBI’s letters dated August 09, 2006 and April 11, 2007. In this regard I have noted that the aforesaid letters reminders were received by the noticee and proof of delivery of the same is on record. Thus it can be concluded that noticee failed to submit any details explanations as sought by SEBI. 15 The noticee had informed BSE vide its letter dated 21st February, 2005 and 28th February 2005 that Jitendranath Alluri sold 400,000 shares through off market deals, but it is noted from the investigation report that the trades were carried out in the market. So it can be concluded that noticee had again submitted wrong disclosures to BSE with regard to manner of sale of shares by promoters. 16 It is further alleged in the IR that on personal visit by the SEBI officer at the address of the company it appeared that the company was No operational from the said address as no person for the company was available, although the same address is being publicized on the BSE Website. 17 Thus it can be concluded from the above that for shri Jitendranath Alluri, the noticee had failed to comply with the provisions of Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI SAST Regulations and for Ms. Rajeshwari Alluri, noticee had failed to comply with both the provisions of Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI SAST Regulations and Regulation 13 (6) of the SEBI PIT Regulations. 18 The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs. Shri Ram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216(SC) held that once the violation of statutory regulations is established, imposition of penalty becomes sine qua No of violation and the intention of parties committing such violation becomes totally irrelevant. 19 I would also like to quote the judgement of Hon’ble SAT, in Appeal No 152 of 2009 – Mr. Ranjan Verghese v. The Adjudicating Officer, Securities and Exchange Board of India, dated 22-09-2009 in which the Hon’ble Tribunal has observed that- “Once it is established that the mandatory provisions of the Takeover Code were violated, the penalty must follow” 20 Further Hon’ble SAT, in Appeal No 66 of 2003 - Milan Mahendra Securities Pvt Ltd Vs SEBI, has also observed, “the purpose of these disclosures is to bring about transparency in the transactions and assist the Regulator to effectively monitor the transactions in the market.” 21 No compliance with the disclosure regulations mentioned above attracts penalty under Section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act, 1992 which reads as under: Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act,1992 reads:- 15A. Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. - If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,- (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, which ever is less; 22 In this regard, the provisions of Section 15J of the SEBI Act and Rule 5 of the Rules require that while adjudging the quantum of penalty, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors namely; a) the amount of disproportionate gains or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default and; c) the repetitive nature of the default. 23 It is also to be noted that as per the Investigation report no quantifiable figures are made available on record to assess the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the No disclosures by the noticee, as stipulated under Regulation 13 (6) of the SEBI PIT Regulations and Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI SAST Regulations. I have also noted that noticee failed to submit information in response to SEBI’s letter reminder dated August 09, 2006 and April 11, 2007 even though these letters were received by the noticee and failed to respond to SCN & hearing notices without furnishing any reason. I have also noted that noticee being a listed company failed No only to respond to the regulator but also failed to co-operate refused to accept the letter in quasi judicial proceedings against it which is No expected from a list company. 24 In view of the above, I am satisfied that the present case warrants imposition of penalty as per the provisions of section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act, 1992. Having considered the facts and circumstances of this case and after taking into account the factors under section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992, I find that a penalty of Rs. 15,00,000 (Rs. Fifteen Lakhs ) only would be commensurate with the default by the noticee in this case. ORDER 25 Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, in terms of the provisions of Section 15 A (b)of the SEBI Act and Rule 5 of the Rules, I, hereby impose a penalty of Rs. 15,00,000 (Rs. Fifteen Lakhs ) only against Systel Infotech Limited having address at 18, Medon House, Vanka Mohalla, 4th Floor, Dr. M. B. Welkar Street, Chira Bazar, Mumbai – 400 002 for failure to comply with Regulation 13 (6) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 and Regulation 8 (3) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that this penalty is justified and appropriate. 26 The penalty shall be paid by way of Demand Draft drawn in favour of “SEBI – Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order. The said demand draft shall be forwarded to General Manager, Investigation Department, ID-8, Securities and Exchange Board of India, SEBI Bhavan, Plot No C4-A, “G” Block, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra (East), Mumbai–400 051. 27 In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules 1995, copies of this order are being sent to Systel Infotech Limited and to Securities and Exchange Board of India, Mumbai.

In response to the allegations made in the SCN, the Noticee has contended that 1,20,000 shares were pledged with J M Financial on 11.12.2012 and the said transaction was intimated to stock exchanges on 21.12.2012 and there was a delay of 3 days and the same may be condoned. Regarding release of pledge on shares, the Noticee has contended that on 27.12.2012 the pledge on 5 lakh shares were released by IFCI Limited and the same was duly intimated to stock exchanges on 04.01.2013. With respect to the off-market transaction of 1,60,000 shares, the Noticee has contended that the same was No an off-market transaction but was only a transfer from the Noticee's one DP account to its another DP account. Regarding the off-market transaction of 5 lakh shares on 31.12.2012, the Noticee has contended that transfer of 4 lakh shares was made to Sarsen Securities Private Limited upon availing a loan by the Noticee and hence such a transaction will No have the effect of off-market transfer and has the effect of an ordinary pledge. The said transaction happened on 31.12.2012 and the same has been reported to the exchanges on 04.01.2013. The balance 1 lakh shares were lying with Destimoney. 10. On perusal of the documents available on record and the contentions of the Noticee, I find that regarding the creation of pledge of 1,20,000 shares on 11.12.2012, the Noticee had made disclosure on 21.12.2012. The Noticee has also requested to condone the delay of 3 days. The release of pledge of 5 lakh shares on 27.12.2012 was reported on 4.01.2013. In view of the above, I Adjudication Order in the matter of Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Limited find that the Noticee has made necessary disclosures with respect to creation release of pledge. In view of the same I take a lenient view with regard to the delay in reporting with respect to the creation of pledge on 11.12.2012. Hence, I exonerate the Noticee of charges of SAST Regulations. 11. I find that the off-market transaction 1,60,000 shares has No constituted any change in shareholding in the company as the same was only a transfer from his one DP account to another DP account hence the same was No required to be reported. Regarding the transfer of 5,00,00 shares on 31.12.2012, I find that the shares were transferred from his account to Destimoney for the purpose of creation of pledge. It has been submitted that out these, 4 lakh shares were pledged with Sarsen Securities Private Limited and balance 1 lakh was lying with Destimoney on behalf of the Noticee (copy of letter from Destimoney submitted). I also find that the Noticee has made requisite disclosures for creation of pledge of 4 lakh shares on 04.01.2013 which is within the due date. In view of the above, I find that the charge of violation of the provisions of regulation 13(4) & (4A) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations is No clearly made out. Hence, I exonerate the Noticee of the charges of regulation 13(4) & (4A) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations. Order 12. In view of the foregoing, the alleged violation of the provisions of SAST Regulations and PIT Regulations by the Noticee as specified in the SCN does No stand established and the matter is, accordingly, disposed off. 13. In terms of rule 6 of the Rules, copies of this Order are being sent to the Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as ‘SEBI’) investigated into various price sensitive disclosures made by M s Suzlon Energy Limited (hereinafter referred to as ‘Suzlon the company’) for the period of November 3, 2009 and December 2, 2009. 2. During the course of investigation it was observed that Suzlon had amended its code of internal procedures and conduct for prevention of insider trading for listed companies (“Code of Conduct”) in line with amendments in SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as “PIT Regulations”) Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 notified on November 19, 2008 only on February 4th, 2011 i.e. after a delay of more than 2 years. Further no mechanism for pre-clearance of trades was incorporated in the Code of Conduct despite being mandated by the PIT Regulations. 3. It was alleged that the Code of Conduct was to be implemented under the overall supervision of the Board of Directors of Suzlon (hereinafter referred to as “the Board”). Shri Pradip Kumar Khaitan (hereinafter referred to as “the Noticee”), was a Non-Executive Independent Director of the Company during the relevant period. As a member of the Board, the Noticee was also allegedly responsible for the delay in amendment and implementation of the Code of Conduct. As a result of this delay, the Board, including the Noticee, was alleged to have violated Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations and was therefore liable for monetary penalty under section 15HB of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act”). APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 4. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer vide order of SEBI dated April 17, 2012 under section 15-I of the Act read with rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalty by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the Adjudicating Rules) to inquire into and adjudge under Section 15HB of the Act, the alleged violation of the provisions of Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations. Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING 5. A show cause notice (hereinafter referred to as SCN) in terms of the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudicating Rules was issued to the Noticee on June 19, 2012 seeking reply of the Noticee as to why an inquiry should No be held against him in respect of the violations alleged to have been committed by him. 6. In response to the said SCN, Authorised Representative of the Noticee vide letter dated June 27, 2012 sought extension of time till September 10, 2012 to file a reply. An extension upto July 31, 2012 was granted to Noticee for filing his reply. 7. Authorised Representative of the Noticee again vide letter dated July 26, 2012 sought extension of time till August 31, 2012 to file a reply. In the said letter it was submitted that the Noticee has ceased to be a Director of Suzlon with effect from April 28, 2011 and that the Noticee has neither committed any default No has violated any of the provisions as alleged. 8. The Noticee submitted a detailed reply vide letter dated July 31, 2012 and desired a personal hearing in the matter. The Noticee’s main submissions in respect of the charges in the SCN are given as under :  \" I respectfully state and submit that the Notice proceeds on the incorrect assumption that I was present in the Board meetings on 31 July 2009, 29 May 2010, 13 August 2010 and 4 February 2011 when the issue of change in Code of Conduct was discussed. This will be evident from the Constitution of Board alongwith the Directors attending the meeting during the relevant period which is enclosed as Annexure IV of the said Notice. The fact that I did No attend and Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 was No present at the Board Meetings held on 31 July 2009, 29 May 2010, 13 August 2010 and 4 February 2011 has also been confirmed by Mr. Hemal Kanuga on behalf of the Company in his mail dated 28 July 2012 upon a specific request being made by Khaitan & Co on my behalf. .................  I was a Non-Executive Independent Director of the Company during the period 25 August 2004 to 28 April 2011. During the said relevant period as non-Executive Independent Director of the said Company, I had nothing to do with the day to day management of the said company or its affairs or any of its departments No I had control over or knowledge of day to day working and management of the affairs of the Company No was I in charge of or responsible to the Company for the conduct of its day to-day business in any manner. As a non- Executive Independent Director I used to participate, whenever possible, in the meetings of the board of directors of the Company. I had nothing to do with any of the alleged activities or violation which are the subject matter of the aforesaid Notice. Consequently I did No have any knowledge of the alleged contravention.  .......... it is well settled that simply because a person is a director of a Company, for this reason alone no proceedings could be initiated or held against him under the aforesaid provisions. There is no evidence to show that there was any act committed by me from which a reasonable inference could be drawn implicating me for the alleged contravention in any manner whatsoever. It is No well settled that only when it is established that a director was actually responsible for the affairs of the Company that a director can be said to be liable and No otherwise. In this connection reference may kindly be made, inter alia, to the following cases: Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 1. G. L. Gupta -vs- D. N. Mehta (AIR 1971 S.C. 2162) 2. B.P. Khaitan -vs- Special director, Enforcement Directorate 1977 Cr. L.J. 1821 (Cal.).  In the aforesaid Calcutta High Court judgement the Hon'ble Court was pleased to hold, inter alia, that in order to be made vicariously liable, the person must be shown to have been a person who was in charge of or was responsible to the Company for the conduct of the business of the Company. A director simplicitor as such cannot be said to be the person who was in charge of and was responsible to the Company for the conduct of its business.  In the premises I could No be made or held liable or responsible for the alleged contravention the said provisions. I further state and submit that none of the conditions precedent for invoking the aforesaid provisions of the Act, Rules and or the Regulations mentioned above have been or are satisfied and or fulfilled in the case and, therefore, none of the said provisions could be applied and or made applicable. ...........................  ................... Requirements of mens rea or actual act of commission or omission by the person charged with violation of the said provisions of the said Act, Rules and or Regulations are essential. The conditions precedent for invoking the said provisions against me have No been or cannot be satisfied. I respectfully state and submit that the contravention, if at all any, had taken place without my knowledge or consent or connivance and the same was No attributable to any negligence on my part.......................\" Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 9. In the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry as per rule 4 (3) of the Rules, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing before me on August 8, 2012. The Noticee attended the said hearing through his authorized representatives (hereinafter referred to as the ‘AR’) and reiterated the submission made in the reply dated July 31, 2012. It was emphasized that the Noticee did No attend the Board meetings in which the issue was considered. AR also submitted copies of the following judgments in support of his contention: i. M s Vijay Remedies Ltd & Ors v. SEBI (Appeal No 49 of 2003 decided on February 11, 2005) ii. G. L. Gupta -vs- D. N. Mehta (AIR 1971 S.C. 2162) iii. B.P. Khaitan -vs- Special director, Enforcement Directorate 1977 Cr. L.J. 1821 (Cal.). 10. After the hearing, the Noticee again vide letter dated August 10, 2012 submitted, inter alia, that \"In the course of personal hearing, from the submissions made on behalf of SEBI as also from the Record of Hearing, it transpires that the scope and purport of the aforesaid show cause notice is being sought to be completely changed by contending that certain factual allegations made in the said show cause notice were inadvertently included. It further transpired that vicarious liability is sought to be invoked by SEBI for fastening liability on me notwithstanding my No having attending any Board meeting at which the relevant agenda was considered. While maintaining that such an attempt is legally untenable and impermissible, I pray and submit that the moment the assumption on the basis of which the said show cause notice has been issued is removed nothing survives in the present proceedings and the show cause notice is liable to be and should be dropped and or quashed and or rescinded....\" Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 11. Noticee vide letter dated August 22, 2012 further submitted that \"..... mens rea or guilty intention becomes and is relevant for the purpose of deciding whether there has been any breach of the provisions of the Act as alleged which are quasi criminal in nature. I further state and submit that even in the case of breach of civil obligation or civil liability provisions, the principles of mens rea have relevance while determining the quantum of penalty to be imposed which is discretionary. Such discretion is required to be exercised judiciously. In the appropriate cases such as the present one penalty may No be imposed at all. Existence of special and attenuating circumstances or factors as mentioned in my earlier reply justify the waiver of penalty. I further submit that your honour is No required or obliged to impose penalty, much less maximum penalty, under all the circumstances. Absence of malafides or malafide intention in the alleged infraction of the relevant provisions is relevant on the question of quantum of penalty. Thus, lack of mens rea or guilty intention, as in the present case, is a relevant consideration in determining the quantum of penalty. Your honour has discretion while determining the quantum of penalty even in those cases where mens rea is No essential for fixing the civil liability. Such discretion, in my respectful submission, is required to be exercised judiciously.\" 12. To further support his argument, the Noticee in the letter dated August 22, 2012 referred to cases of Shanti Prasad Jain v. Director of Enforcement (AIR 1962 S.C. 1764), Hindustan Steel Ltd v. State of Orissa {(1972) 83 I.T.R. 26 (S.C.)} and Bharjatiya Steel Industries v Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. {(2008) 11 SCC 617}. Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS: 13. I have carefully perused the charges against the Noticee mentioned in the SCN, the submissions of the Noticee and the documents available on record. The issue that arises for consideration in the present case is stated and determined, as follows:  Whether the Noticee has violated Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations? 14. Before proceeding to decide the above issue, it is important to have a look at the abovementioned provisions as they existed at the relevant time, which interalia are reproduced below. PIT Regulations “Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities. 12. (1) All listed companies and organisations associated with securities markets including : (a) the intermediaries as mentioned in section 12 of the Act, asset management company and trustees of mutual funds ; (b) the self-regulatory organisations recognised or authorised by the Board; (c) the recognised stock exchanges and clearing house or corporations; (d) the public financial institutions as defined in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956; and (e) the professional firms such as auditors, accountancy firms, law firms, analysts, consultants, etc., assisting or advising listed companies, Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 shall frame a code of internal procedures and conduct as near thereto the Model Code specified in Schedule I of these Regulations without diluting it in any manner and ensure compliance of the same.” Model Code of Conduct, Schedule I, Part A under Reg. 12(1) of PIT Regulations 1.0 Compliance Officer 1.1 … 1.2 The compliance officer shall be responsible for setting forth policies, procedures, monitoring adherence to the rules for the preservation of “Price Sensitive Information”, pre-clearing; of designated employees’ and their dependents’ trades (directly or through respective department heads as decided by the company), monitoring of trades and the implementation of the code of conduct under the overall supervision of the Board of the listed company.” 15. Suzlon, as a listed company, was required to comply with the PIT Regulations and accordingly had to implement code of Conduct as required by Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations. The PIT Regulations were amended and the amendments were notified in official gazette on November 19, 2008. Accordingly, Suzlon was required to amend its code of conduct in line with the amendments in PIT Regulations. However, Suzlon implemented the amended Code of Conduct only on February 4th, 2011, which is more than 2 years after the notification. This huge delay occurred in spite of Suzlon’s Board of Directors being aware about the changes in PIT Regulations. The Board was informed about the changes in the PIT regulations in the meeting dated July 31, 2009 by Mr. Sundar Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 Rajagopalan, who was the President (Legal) and General Counsel of Suzlon. The Board unduly delayed the implementation of revised Code of Conduct by deferring the matter when it was listed as agenda item in the Board meetings dated May 29, 2010 and August 13, 2010 and the code was subsequently passed in the board meeting dated February 4, 2011. 16. It is clear from the material available on record that the Board was aware of the requirement to implement a new code of conduct and inspite of this, the Board deferred the deliberation on the code of conduct for two meetings. Thus, it is clear that Suzlon delayed the implementation of new code of conduct. As per Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations, the compliance officer is responsible for implementation of Code of conduct under the overall supervision of the Board. In the present matter it is clear that the Board, by delaying the implementation, has acted in violation of the above mentioned provision. 17. The Noticee in his reply and during personal hearing put forward various contentions and it was emphasized that the Noticee did No attend the Board meetings in which the issue was considered. 18. I note that the Noticee was admittedly Non-Executive Independent Director of the Company during the period August 25, 2004 to April 28, 2011. The Board of Suzlon, after granting approval for drafting a new code of conduct, was supposed to discuss it in the meeting held on May 29, 2010. The time period between authorization for drafting a new code and discussing it is nearly 10 months, which appears to be excessive. However, the new code of conduct could No be discussed by the Board on May 29, 2010 and it was kept in Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 abeyance. The said draft was supposed to be considered again in the meeting dated August 13, 2010, but even in this meeting the issue could No be discussed. Finally, the draft was considered and approved in the meeting held on February 4, 2011 which was after more than 2 years of amendment of PIT Regulations. 19. I have perused the papers relating to the Board of directors of Suzlon at the time of relevant Board meetings i.e. from November 19, 2008 till February 4, 2011. I note that the Noticee's name figured in the list of the Board of Directors of Suzlon in all the four relevant meetings when the issue of change in the code of conduct was to be discussed. However, it is observed from the details of Board meeting attendance provided by Suzlon that the Noticee did No attend these four Board meetings. 20. The Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the case of N. Narayanan v. The Adjudicating Officer, SEBI (Appeal No 29 of 2012 decided on October 5, 2012) while commenting on the role of directors, had observed that \"With the changing scenario in the corporate world the concept of corporate responsibilities is also rapidly changing day by day. The director of a company cannot confine himself to lending his name to the company but taking light responsibility for its day to day management. While functions may be delegated to professionals, the duty of care, diligence, verification of critical points by directors cannot be abdicated. The directors are expected to have a hands on approach in the running of the company and take up responsibility No only for the achievements of the company but also the failings thereto.\" 21. Thus the role of director and the responsibilities attached to that position in a listed company cannot be underestimated. Even though Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 the Noticee was a Non-executive Independent Director of the Company and No involved in day to day management, it was expected from him to oversee the functioning of the company. As the Noticee was No present in any of the four Board Meetings dealing with the issue of change in the code of conduct, it would be difficult for the Noticee to monitor this issue. Although the entire Board of the company is responsible for the delay of over 2 years in the implementation of the code of conduct, it would be difficult to attribute the said delay on the Noticee. Thus, I am of the opinion that the Noticee can be given benefit of doubt for the delay caused in implementation of code of conduct by Suzlon. 22. In view of the above observations, findings and material on record I conclude that the allegation of violation of Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations by the Noticee is No proved. ORDER 23. In view of the foregoing, the alleged violation of the provisions of PIT Regulations by the Noticee, as specified in the SCN dated June 19, 2012 does No stand established and the matter is, accordingly, disposed of. 24. In terms of the Rule 6 of the Adjudicating Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.

A notice to show cause dated February 26, 2009 under Rule 4 of the Adjudicating Rules was issued to the Noticee asking it to show cause as to why an enquiry should No be held against it and the prescribed penalty for the alleged violation of PIT Regulations and the Takeover Code No be imposed under Section 15A (b) of SEBI Act. The said Notice to show cause was sent by Registered Post Acknowledgment Due, under rule 7(b) of the Adjudicating Rules and was returned with the comments “no such address to sender”. Subsequently the show cause notice was served on the Noticee under rule 7(c) of the Adjudicating Rules on June 9, 2009. 3. Thereafter, a Notice for Hearing dated August 26, 2009, under Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules was issued to the Noticee, fixing the hearing on 7th September, 2009 at 4:00 PM and sent via Regd. Post. The said Notice was also served on the Noticee in terms of Rule 7(c) of the of the Adjudication Rules on September 01, 2009. 4. In the instant matter the following issues arise for consideration: a. Whether the Noticee had violated regulation 13(3) of the PIT Regulations? b. Whether the Noticee had violated regulation 7(1) of the Takeover Code? c. Whether the Noticee is liable for imposition of monetary penalty under section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act? 5. Following are the relevant provisions of the PIT Regulations and the Takeover Code which read as under: PIT Regulations: “13(3) Continual disclosure. (3) Any person who holds more than 5% shares for voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company in Form C the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights, even if such change results in shareholding falling below 5%, if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under sub-regulation (1) or under this sub- regulation; and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company.” Takeover Code: “Acquisition of 5 per cent and more shares or voting rights of a company. 7. (1) Any acquirer, who acquires shares or voting rights which (taken together with shares or voting rights, if any, held by him) would entitle him to more than five per cent or ten per cent or fourteen per cent or fifty four per cent or seventy four per cent shares or voting rights in a company, in any manner whatsoever, shall disclose at every stage the aggregate of his shareholding or voting rights in that company to the company and to the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed.” 6. SEBI conducted investigation into the trading in the shares of IQ Infotech Limited (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Target Company’) and into possible violations of the provisions of the SEBI Act and various rules and regulations made thereunder. During the course of investigations it was observed that the Noticee had purchased 8,986 shares & sold 9,28,600 shares of the Target Company. From off-market data it was observed that DSL had received 9,86,094 shares from Mega Channel Computers Ltd on December 08, 2004. It was further observed that as on December 31, 2004, DSL was holding 9,86,094 shares which was 9.26% of the share capital of the Target Company and that its share holding had reduced to zero by March 31, 2005. 7. During investigation by SEBI it was alleged that the disclosures under Regulation 13(3) of the PIT Regulations and Regulation 7 (1) of the Takeover Code were No made by the Noticee. 8. I have carefully gone through the charges set out in the show cause notice and other documents on record. It is clear that the Noticee had purchased 9,86,094 shares from the off-market on December 8, 2004 which constituted 9.26% of the Target Company’s share capital. Regulation 7(1) of the Takeover Code mandates disclosure in case a person acquires more than 5% of the shares in a company. 9. It is clear from the language of regulation 7(1) of the Takeover Code that DSL was mandated to disclose the purchase of shares to the Target Company as it would entitle it to more than 5% shares in the share capital of the Target Company. Under this regulation it is mandatory to disclose such acquisition to the Target Company and as well as the exchange and whether or No such disclosure was made is a question of fact. During investigation by SEBI it was alleged that no such disclosures were made to the Target Company. 10. It is also evident that as on December 31, 2004 DSL was holding 9,86,094 shares and by March 31, 2005, the shareholding had reduced to zero. 9,86,094 shares constitute 9.26% of the Target company and under regulation 13(3) any person who holds more than 5% of the share capital of a company has to disclose any change in that shareholding exceeding 2%. 11. It is clear from a plain reading of regulation 13(3), that the Noticee was required to disclose the change in it’s shareholding in the Target Company. The violation of regulation 13(3) is a question of fact; whether the Noticee had made disclosures under regulation 13(3) or not. During investigation by SEBI it was alleged that no such disclosures were made to the Target Company. 12. Further, the noticee did No file any reply to the show cause notice issued by the undersigned. Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the matter of Classic Credit Limited Vs. SEBI(APPEAL No 68 OF 2003, date of decision December 8, 2006) regarding the significance of the filling the reply to the show cause notice, stated as follows “ the appellant did No file any reply to the second show cause Notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that the charges alleged against them in the show cause notice were admitted by them.” 13. In the instant matter as the Noticee has failed to file any reply to the show cause notice, I am inclined to conclude that the Noticee had failed to make the mandatory disclosers under the PIT Regulations and the Takeover Code and therefore violated the provisions of regulation 13(3) and regulation 7(1) of the PIT Regulations and the Takeover Code respectively. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs. Shri Ram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216(SC) held that “once the violation of statutory regulations is established, imposition of penalty becomes sine qua No of violation and the intention of parties committing such violation becomes totally irrelevant. Once the contravention is established, then the penalty is to follow.” 14. Thus, I conclude that the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A (b) of the Act which states as under :- “Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. 15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,— (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less;” 15. Further, on the determination of the quantum of penalty under section 15A (b), it is required to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of the Act, which reads as under:- “Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer. 15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.” 16. From the material available on record, it is No possible to ascertain the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage to the Noticee, which may have accrued due to the aforesaid violation. However, it is established that the Noticee had failed to disclose the acquisition of shares and the change in its shareholding pattern to the Target Company and consequently proper disclosures were No made to the exchange. Correct and timely disclosures are an essential part of the proper functioning of the securities market and any failure to do so results in preventing the investors from taking a well-informed decision. Further, I do No find that the nature of the violation in this case is repetitive. ORDER: 17. In view of the above, after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and exercising the powers conferred upon me U s 15-I(2) of the Act, I hereby impose a penalty of Rs.1,00,000 - (Rupees One Lakh Only) on Dynamic Securities Ltd u s 15A (b) of the SEBI Act. I am of view that the said penalty is commensurate with the violations made by Dynamic Securities Ltd 18. The above penalty amount shall be paid through a duly crossed demand draft drawn in favour of “SEBI – Penalties Remittable to Government of India” and payable at Mumbai, within 45 days of receipt of this order. The said demand draft should be forwarded to Securities and Exchange Board of India, SEBI Bhavan, Plot No C4-A, “G” Block, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra(East), Mumbai- 400 051. 19. In terms of the Rule 6 of the Adjudicating Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India. Dt: November 12, 2009 J.

During the course of investigation it was observed that Suzlon had amended its code of internal procedures and conduct for prevention of insider trading for listed companies (“Code of Conduct”) in line with amendments in SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as “PIT Regulations”) Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 notified on November 19, 2008 only on February 4th, 2011 i.e. after a delay of more than 2 years. Further no mechanism for pre-clearance of trades was incorporated in the Code of Conduct despite being mandated by the PIT Regulations. 3. It was alleged that the Code of Conduct was to be implemented under the overall supervision of the Board of Directors of Suzlon (hereinafter referred to as “the Board”). Shri Pradip Kumar Khaitan (hereinafter referred to as “the Noticee”), was a Non-Executive Independent Director of the Company during the relevant period. As a member of the Board, the Noticee was also allegedly responsible for the delay in amendment and implementation of the Code of Conduct. As a result of this delay, the Board, including the Noticee, was alleged to have violated Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations and was therefore liable for monetary penalty under section 15HB of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act”). APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 4. The undersigned was appointed as the Adjudicating Officer vide order of SEBI dated April 17, 2012 under section 15-I of the Act read with rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalty by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the Adjudicating Rules) to inquire into and adjudge under Section 15HB of the Act, the alleged violation of the provisions of Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations. Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING 5. A show cause notice (hereinafter referred to as SCN) in terms of the provisions of Rule 4(1) of the Adjudicating Rules was issued to the Noticee on June 19, 2012 seeking reply of the Noticee as to why an inquiry should No be held against him in respect of the violations alleged to have been committed by him. 6. In response to the said SCN, Authorised Representative of the Noticee vide letter dated June 27, 2012 sought extension of time till September 10, 2012 to file a reply. An extension upto July 31, 2012 was granted to Noticee for filing his reply. 7. Authorised Representative of the Noticee again vide letter dated July 26, 2012 sought extension of time till August 31, 2012 to file a reply. In the said letter it was submitted that the Noticee has ceased to be a Director of Suzlon with effect from April 28, 2011 and that the Noticee has neither committed any default No has violated any of the provisions as alleged. 8. The Noticee submitted a detailed reply vide letter dated July 31, 2012 and desired a personal hearing in the matter. The Noticee’s main submissions in respect of the charges in the SCN are given as under :  \" I respectfully state and submit that the Notice proceeds on the incorrect assumption that I was present in the Board meetings on 31 July 2009, 29 May 2010, 13 August 2010 and 4 February 2011 when the issue of change in Code of Conduct was discussed. This will be evident from the Constitution of Board alongwith the Directors attending the meeting during the relevant period which is enclosed as Annexure IV of the said Notice. The fact that I did No attend and Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 was No present at the Board Meetings held on 31 July 2009, 29 May 2010, 13 August 2010 and 4 February 2011 has also been confirmed by Mr. Hemal Kanuga on behalf of the Company in his mail dated 28 July 2012 upon a specific request being made by Khaitan & Co on my behalf. .................  I was a Non-Executive Independent Director of the Company during the period 25 August 2004 to 28 April 2011. During the said relevant period as non-Executive Independent Director of the said Company, I had nothing to do with the day to day management of the said company or its affairs or any of its departments No I had control over or knowledge of day to day working and management of the affairs of the Company No was I in charge of or responsible to the Company for the conduct of its day to-day business in any manner. As a non- Executive Independent Director I used to participate, whenever possible, in the meetings of the board of directors of the Company. I had nothing to do with any of the alleged activities or violation which are the subject matter of the aforesaid Notice. Consequently I did No have any knowledge of the alleged contravention.  .......... it is well settled that simply because a person is a director of a Company, for this reason alone no proceedings could be initiated or held against him under the aforesaid provisions. There is no evidence to show that there was any act committed by me from which a reasonable inference could be drawn implicating me for the alleged contravention in any manner whatsoever. It is No well settled that only when it is established that a director was actually responsible for the affairs of the Company that a director can be said to be liable and No otherwise. In this connection reference may kindly be made, inter alia, to the following cases: Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 1. G. L. Gupta -vs- D. N. Mehta (AIR 1971 S.C. 2162) 2. B.P. Khaitan -vs- Special director, Enforcement Directorate 1977 Cr. L.J. 1821 (Cal.).  In the aforesaid Calcutta High Court judgement the Hon'ble Court was pleased to hold, inter alia, that in order to be made vicariously liable, the person must be shown to have been a person who was in charge of or was responsible to the Company for the conduct of the business of the Company. A director simplicitor as such cannot be said to be the person who was in charge of and was responsible to the Company for the conduct of its business.  In the premises I could No be made or held liable or responsible for the alleged contravention the said provisions. I further state and submit that none of the conditions precedent for invoking the aforesaid provisions of the Act, Rules and or the Regulations mentioned above have been or are satisfied and or fulfilled in the case and, therefore, none of the said provisions could be applied and or made applicable. ...........................  ................... Requirements of mens rea or actual act of commission or omission by the person charged with violation of the said provisions of the said Act, Rules and or Regulations are essential. The conditions precedent for invoking the said provisions against me have No been or cannot be satisfied. I respectfully state and submit that the contravention, if at all any, had taken place without my knowledge or consent or connivance and the same was No attributable to any negligence on my part.......................\" Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 9. In the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry as per rule 4 (3) of the Rules, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing before me on August 8, 2012. The Noticee attended the said hearing through his authorized representatives (hereinafter referred to as the ‘AR’) and reiterated the submission made in the reply dated July 31, 2012. It was emphasized that the Noticee did No attend the Board meetings in which the issue was considered. AR also submitted copies of the following judgments in support of his contention: i. M s Vijay Remedies Ltd & Ors v. SEBI (Appeal No 49 of 2003 decided on February 11, 2005) ii. G. L. Gupta -vs- D. N. Mehta (AIR 1971 S.C. 2162) iii. B.P. Khaitan -vs- Special director, Enforcement Directorate 1977 Cr. L.J. 1821 (Cal.). 10. After the hearing, the Noticee again vide letter dated August 10, 2012 submitted, inter alia, that \"In the course of personal hearing, from the submissions made on behalf of SEBI as also from the Record of Hearing, it transpires that the scope and purport of the aforesaid show cause notice is being sought to be completely changed by contending that certain factual allegations made in the said show cause notice were inadvertently included. It further transpired that vicarious liability is sought to be invoked by SEBI for fastening liability on me notwithstanding my No having attending any Board meeting at which the relevant agenda was considered. While maintaining that such an attempt is legally untenable and impermissible, I pray and submit that the moment the assumption on the basis of which the said show cause notice has been issued is removed nothing survives in the present proceedings and the show cause notice is liable to be and should be dropped and or quashed and or rescinded....\" Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 11. Noticee vide letter dated August 22, 2012 further submitted that \"..... mens rea or guilty intention becomes and is relevant for the purpose of deciding whether there has been any breach of the provisions of the Act as alleged which are quasi criminal in nature. I further state and submit that even in the case of breach of civil obligation or civil liability provisions, the principles of mens rea have relevance while determining the quantum of penalty to be imposed which is discretionary. Such discretion is required to be exercised judiciously. In the appropriate cases such as the present one penalty may No be imposed at all. Existence of special and attenuating circumstances or factors as mentioned in my earlier reply justify the waiver of penalty. I further submit that your honour is No required or obliged to impose penalty, much less maximum penalty, under all the circumstances. Absence of malafides or malafide intention in the alleged infraction of the relevant provisions is relevant on the question of quantum of penalty. Thus, lack of mens rea or guilty intention, as in the present case, is a relevant consideration in determining the quantum of penalty. Your honour has discretion while determining the quantum of penalty even in those cases where mens rea is No essential for fixing the civil liability. Such discretion, in my respectful submission, is required to be exercised judiciously.\" 12. To further support his argument, the Noticee in the letter dated August 22, 2012 referred to cases of Shanti Prasad Jain v. Director of Enforcement (AIR 1962 S.C. 1764), Hindustan Steel Ltd v. State of Orissa {(1972) 83 I.T.R. 26 (S.C.)} and Bharjatiya Steel Industries v Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. {(2008) 11 SCC 617}. Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS: 13. I have carefully perused the charges against the Noticee mentioned in the SCN, the submissions of the Noticee and the documents available on record. The issue that arises for consideration in the present case is stated and determined, as follows:  Whether the Noticee has violated Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations? 14. Before proceeding to decide the above issue, it is important to have a look at the abovementioned provisions as they existed at the relevant time, which interalia are reproduced below. PIT Regulations “Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities. 12. (1) All listed companies and organisations associated with securities markets including : (a) the intermediaries as mentioned in section 12 of the Act, asset management company and trustees of mutual funds ; (b) the self-regulatory organisations recognised or authorised by the Board; (c) the recognised stock exchanges and clearing house or corporations; (d) the public financial institutions as defined in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956; and (e) the professional firms such as auditors, accountancy firms, law firms, analysts, consultants, etc., assisting or advising listed companies, Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 shall frame a code of internal procedures and conduct as near thereto the Model Code specified in Schedule I of these Regulations without diluting it in any manner and ensure compliance of the same.” Model Code of Conduct, Schedule I, Part A under Reg. 12(1) of PIT Regulations 1.0 Compliance Officer 1.1 … 1.2 The compliance officer shall be responsible for setting forth policies, procedures, monitoring adherence to the rules for the preservation of “Price Sensitive Information”, pre-clearing; of designated employees’ and their dependents’ trades (directly or through respective department heads as decided by the company), monitoring of trades and the implementation of the code of conduct under the overall supervision of the Board of the listed company.” 15. Suzlon, as a listed company, was required to comply with the PIT Regulations and accordingly had to implement code of Conduct as required by Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations. The PIT Regulations were amended and the amendments were notified in official gazette on November 19, 2008. Accordingly, Suzlon was required to amend its code of conduct in line with the amendments in PIT Regulations. However, Suzlon implemented the amended Code of Conduct only on February 4th, 2011, which is more than 2 years after the notification. This huge delay occurred in spite of Suzlon’s Board of Directors being aware about the changes in PIT Regulations. The Board was informed about the changes in the PIT regulations in the meeting dated July 31, 2009 by Mr. Sundar Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 Rajagopalan, who was the President (Legal) and General Counsel of Suzlon. The Board unduly delayed the implementation of revised Code of Conduct by deferring the matter when it was listed as agenda item in the Board meetings dated May 29, 2010 and August 13, 2010 and the code was subsequently passed in the board meeting dated February 4, 2011. 16. It is clear from the material available on record that the Board was aware of the requirement to implement a new code of conduct and inspite of this, the Board deferred the deliberation on the code of conduct for two meetings. Thus, it is clear that Suzlon delayed the implementation of new code of conduct. As per Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations, the compliance officer is responsible for implementation of Code of conduct under the overall supervision of the Board. In the present matter it is clear that the Board, by delaying the implementation, has acted in violation of the above mentioned provision. 17. The Noticee in his reply and during personal hearing put forward various contentions and it was emphasized that the Noticee did No attend the Board meetings in which the issue was considered. 18. I note that the Noticee was admittedly Non-Executive Independent Director of the Company during the period August 25, 2004 to April 28, 2011. The Board of Suzlon, after granting approval for drafting a new code of conduct, was supposed to discuss it in the meeting held on May 29, 2010. The time period between authorization for drafting a new code and discussing it is nearly 10 months, which appears to be excessive. However, the new code of conduct could No be discussed by the Board on May 29, 2010 and it was kept in Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 abeyance. The said draft was supposed to be considered again in the meeting dated August 13, 2010, but even in this meeting the issue could No be discussed. Finally, the draft was considered and approved in the meeting held on February 4, 2011 which was after more than 2 years of amendment of PIT Regulations. 19. I have perused the papers relating to the Board of directors of Suzlon at the time of relevant Board meetings i.e. from November 19, 2008 till February 4, 2011. I note that the Noticee's name figured in the list of the Board of Directors of Suzlon in all the four relevant meetings when the issue of change in the code of conduct was to be discussed. However, it is observed from the details of Board meeting attendance provided by Suzlon that the Noticee did No attend these four Board meetings. 20. The Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the case of N. Narayanan v. The Adjudicating Officer, SEBI (Appeal No 29 of 2012 decided on October 5, 2012) while commenting on the role of directors, had observed that \"With the changing scenario in the corporate world the concept of corporate responsibilities is also rapidly changing day by day. The director of a company cannot confine himself to lending his name to the company but taking light responsibility for its day to day management. While functions may be delegated to professionals, the duty of care, diligence, verification of critical points by directors cannot be abdicated. The directors are expected to have a hands on approach in the running of the company and take up responsibility No only for the achievements of the company but also the failings thereto.\" 21. Thus the role of director and the responsibilities attached to that position in a listed company cannot be underestimated. Even though Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 the Noticee was a Non-executive Independent Director of the Company and No involved in day to day management, it was expected from him to oversee the functioning of the company. As the Noticee was No present in any of the four Board Meetings dealing with the issue of change in the code of conduct, it would be difficult for the Noticee to monitor this issue. Although the entire Board of the company is responsible for the delay of over 2 years in the implementation of the code of conduct, it would be difficult to attribute the said delay on the Noticee. Thus, I am of the opinion that the Noticee can be given benefit of doubt for the delay caused in implementation of code of conduct by Suzlon. 22. In view of the above observations, findings and material on record I conclude that the allegation of violation of Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations by the Noticee is No proved. ORDER 23. In view of the foregoing, the alleged violation of the provisions of PIT Regulations by the Noticee, as specified in the SCN dated June 19, 2012 does No stand established and the matter is, accordingly, disposed of. 24. In terms of the Rule 6 of the Adjudicating Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.

The investigation conducted by SEBI revealed that M s Pragari Finvest (India) Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Noticee”) had failed to comply with regulation 13(3) read with regulation 13(5) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as “SEBI (PIT)”. It was alleged that the Noticee had violated the provisions of the said regulations and therefore, liable for monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as ‘SEBI Act’). APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 3. The undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer, vide order dated March 17, 2008 under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalty by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Rules’) to inquire into and adjudge under section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act the alleged violation of regulation 13(3) read with regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT). SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND PERSONAL HEARING 4. Show Cause Notice (EAD-2 SD PM 133521 2008) dated July 30, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as “SCN”) was issued to the Noticee under rule 4 of the Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be initiated against the Noticee and penalty be No imposed under section 15A(b) of SEBI Act for Noticee’s failure to comply with the provisions of regulations 13(3) read with 13(5) of SEBI (PIT). 5. The Noticee vide its letter dated September 02, 2008 replied to the said SCN. The extracts of the reply of the Noticee, inter-alia are stated as under:- • We sold the shares of MSFL during the period of February 2005. Our holding & disclosures were made to public by the disclosure of the shareholding pattern as filed under cl. 35 of the Listing Agreement. SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 also talks about a disclosure which will No mislead the public. Small company like us, it is burdensome, troublesome & very difficult to keep thousand of regulations & compliance thereof for no reason. The object set out by regulator is simple No to mislead the public. • There were no corporate announcements of intimation at that time by MSFL. We sold the shares as part of our immediate financial need at that time for our survival. The Shareholding Pattern under cl. 35 of the Listing Agreement which per se a market disclosure for the quarter ended 31st March 2005 intimated & published in the BSE site talks about the sell of shares. Our sell of shares neither affected the market No related to any alleged manipulation of the script. It was a mere submission of the sell of the shares under the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulation, 1992. • Taking into account the object of the regulation & the need for the disclosure, in this case our No disclosure had No impacted anybody. 6. In the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry in terms of rule 4(3) of the Rules, the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on March 18, 2009. Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mishra appeared on behalf of the Noticee and submitted, inter alia, as under: i. The promoters of all the three companies are same i.e. a. M s. Clarus Finance & Securities Limited (formerly known as Mittal Securities Finance limited – a BSE listed Company; b. M s. Platinum Finvest Private limited; and c. M s. Pragari Finvest Private Limited. ii. The company sold part of shares of M s. Mittal securities during the period February 2, 2005 to February 14, 2005 to return the loan of MSL. iii. The company is a small company. And it was difficult at the relevant time to appoint and manage persons who has adequate knowledge of Securities Act and Regulations as framed under the SEBI Act. iv. It is an admitted position that we failed to make intimation disclosures as required under regulation 13(3) & 13 (5) of the IT Regulation 1992 to (i) the company for the following reasons : a. The companies involved are small companies; b. There were no adequate and qualified staff; c. The promoters were No well conversant with the said applicable regulations i.e. IT Regulation 1992; d. The error was inadvertent and accidental (for lack of knowledge of the applicable Regulation) ; v. The disclosure under regulation 13(3) & 13 (5) of the IT Regulation 1992 with the stock Exchange are purely for dissemination of information for use of public. The object of the legislation is purely to protect the interest of the investors. Though our sale of shares we failed to intimate under the said regulation but till as on date there were no complaint or reference of the alleged sale against the interest of any investor or market per se. vi. The object of IT Regulation 1992 prevent the insiders to No to deal with sensitive and market affected information of the company. Here at that time there were no corporate announcements or any price sensitive information after and before share price remain in the same parlance. vii. The promoters are the 1st Person to know about the inside information’s at first stage. There were no such information, manipulation or use of any hidden facts to their advantage. The sale proceed was returned back to MSL to strength their balance sheet. viii. After receipt of your investigation letter the company took adequate steps for compliance of the IT Regulation 1992 and implemented the code of Insider Trading which was long back adopted by the company in true Spirit. This can be verified by the recent intimations Disclosures to the stock Exchanges. This shows our initiative of No only to admit any fault but also to take adequate steps to prevent and comply any applicable provisions in its true spirit. ix. Under the aforesaid submission, we hereby request you to consider the following facts as well: i. The promoters before and after the sale remain the same; ii. The company & Promoters took all majors to prevent and comply any applicable provisions in its true spirit including that of IT Regulation 1992; iii. Nobody was effected or any complaint ever received by you or the company from any investors for any loss or suffering because of this non-disclosure; iv. the price of the shares in the market remain stable; v. the offence was No repetitive; There were no financial gain or accommodation to the promoters , as the sale proceed was a part of return of the loan to the company by the said promoter group companies. CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 7. I have carefully perused the written and oral submissions of the Noticee and the documents available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are : (i) Whether the Noticee was holding more than 5% of the shares of MSFL prior to sale of the shares? (ii) Whether the Noticee attracted the disclosure requirements under regulation 13(3) read with regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT)? (iii) If so, whether the Noticee had complied with the same or not? (iv) Does the non-compliance, if any, on the part of the Noticee attract monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of SEBI Act? (v) If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of SEBI Act? 8. Before moving forward, it will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of SEBI (PIT), which reads as under: 13(3) Any person who holds more than 5% shares for voting rights in any listed company shall disclose to the company in Form C the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights, even if such change results in shareholding falling below 5%, if there has been change in such holdings from the last disclosure made under sub-regulation (1) or under this sub-regulation (1); and such change exceeds 2% of total shareholding or voting rights in the company. 13(5) The disclosures made in sub-regulations (3) and (4) shall be made within 4 working days of: (a) the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares, or (b) the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights, as the case may be. 9. I find from the materials available on records that the Noticee was holding 4,77,850 shares of MSFL as on March 31st , 2004 i.e. 15.93% shares of MSFL. Moreover in the reply of the Noticee dated January 08, 2008 where the Noticee had acknowledged the receipt of letters sent by investigation department, the Noticee in its para No 8 of the same had mentioned the Noticee’s Shareholding Pattern of MSFL as on December 31st, 2004 (477850 shares of MSFL) & February 28, 2005 (192350 shares of MSFL). Thus, it is evident that prior to the sale of shares of MSFL the Noticee was holding more than 5% of the shares of the company (MSFL). 10. As per the Noticee’s reply dated January 08, 2008, Noticee sold 2,85,500 shares of MSFL but as per the details given by the Noticee’s broker through whom the Noticee had sold shares, the Noticee sold 2,90,500 shares of MSFL during the Investigation Period. Since, the sale is more than 2% it has to be disclosed to the MSFL in Form C as prescribed in Regulation 13(3) of PIT & within time as prescribed in Regulation 13(5) of PIT. 11. In terms of regulation 13(3) read with 13(5) of SEBI (PIT), any person who holds more than 5% of shares or voting rights in a listed company is required to disclose to the company the number of shares or voting rights held and change in shareholding or voting rights 12. I find that with the sale of 2,90,500 shares, the Noticee crossed the limit of 2% specified in the aforesaid regulations. Further, with the said sale, the shareholding of the Noticee came down from 15.93% to 6.25% (approx). Thus, the Noticee had attracted the disclosure requirements under regulations 13(3) and 13(5) of SEBI (PIT). 13. The next issue for consideration is whether the Noticee had complied with the disclosure requirements under regulation 13(3) read with regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT). 14. However, I don’t find any merits in its reply & I am of the view that the ignorance of law is no excuse & it is no defence for the Noticee to state that it is very small company & has No employed adequate & qualified staff. If it can’t employ such adequate & qualified staff then there is no need of such company which can’t comply with the statutory requirements & moreover such company should No acquire or hold shares in such huge quantities. Moreover, the Noticee in its reply dated March 18, 2009 had admitted that it had No made the requisite disclosure due to reasons referred above. Hence, I am of the view that the Noticee had No complied with the disclosure requirements of regulations 13(3) and 13(5) of SEBI (PIT). Therefore, the violation of the said provisions stands established. 15. The next issue for consideration is as to whether failure on the part of the Noticee to comply with the provisions of SEBI (PIT) attracts monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of SEBI Act, and if so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee. 16. The provisions of section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act is reproduced here under : Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. 15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under,- (a) …………………………. (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less; (c) …………………………. 17. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs. Shri Ram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216 (SC) inter-alia held that “once the violation of statutory regulations is established, imposition of penalty becomes sine qua No of violation and the intention of parties committing such violation becomes totally irrelevant. Once the contravention is established then the penalty is to follow”. 18. In view of the foregoing, I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act. 19. While determining the quantum of monetary penalty under section 15A (b), I have considered the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act, which reads as under:- “15J - Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.” 20. From the material available on record, it may No be possible to ascertain the exact monetary loss to the investors on account of default by the Noticee. The change in the shareholding of the Noticee and timely disclosure thereof, were of some importance from the point of view of outside shareholders other investors as that would have prompted them to buy or sell shares of MSFL. By No complying with the regulatory obligation of making the disclosure when the change in the shareholding of the Noticee exceeded 2%, it had concealed the vital information from the investors. The object of the SEBI (PIT) mandating disclosure of acquisition sale beyond certain quantity is to give equal treatment and opportunity to all shareholders and protect their interests. To translate this objective into reality, measures have been taken by SEBI to bring about transparency in the transactions and it is for this purpose that dissemination of such information is required. The purpose of these disclosures is to bring about transparency in the transactions and assist the Regulator to effectively monitor the transactions in the market. It would, however, be difficult to come to a firm conclusion as to how the general shareholders would have reacted on knowing the aforesaid change in the shareholding of the Noticee. The Noticee could No pre-judge the reaction of the investors. By virtue of the failure on the part of the Noticee to make the necessary disclosure on time, the fact remains that the shareholders investors were deprived of the important information at the relevant point of time. The Noticee had failed to comply with the provisions of Reg. 13(3) & 13(5) of SEBI (PIT) for two times i.e. on February 4, 2005 when the Noticee sold 1,00,000 shares of MSFL & the change in shareholding at that point of time was 3.33 % app. & therefore the Noticee was statutory obligation to disclose the sale of shares within 4 working days of the sale. Moreover, the Noticee had sold 95,500 shares of MSFL on February 7, 2005 & the change in shareholding had exceeded 2 % & therefore the Noticee was under statutory obligation to disclose the number of shares held & change in shareholding within 4 working days. Thus, the nature of default committed by the Noticee can be treated as repetitive. Had there been any investor complaint the violation would have been more serious. ORDER 21. After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case and material available on record, I hereby impose a monetary penalty of Rs. 10,00,000 - (Rupees Ten Lakhs only) on the Noticee which will be commensurate with the default committed by Noticee. 22. The Noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI- Penalties Remittable to Government of India”, payable at Mumbai, within 45 days of receipt of this order. The said demand draft shall be forwarded to General Manager, Investigation Department - Division – ID6, Securities and Exchange Board of India, SEBI Bhavan, Plot No.C4-A, “G” Block, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra (East), Mumbai–400 051. 23. In terms of rule 6 of the Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Simply Class Fashions Pvt Ltd (hereinafter referred to as SCFPL) was holding 18.15% of the shares of Noticee. However, Noticee had informed that due to the mistake by the secretarial staff, SCFPL was erroneously shown in the promoter group and that a revised Clause 35 report of the Listing Agreement was filed by the Noticee with BSE for the quarter ended September 2004. As per the revised clause 35 report of the Listing Agreement, SCFPL was No holding any of the shares of Noticee. However, it was informed by BSE that the exchange did No receive any revised shareholding pattern for the quarter ended September 2004 from Noticee. Further, there was also a discrepancy with regard to information submitted by Noticee under Regulation 8(2) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as SAST Regulations). Noticee had disclosed incorrect promoter shareholding in various quarters in violation of Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement read with Clause 5.1 of Schedule II of Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for Prevention of the Insider Trading under Regulation 12(2) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as 'PIT Regulations'). 3. SEBI has, therefore, initiated adjudication proceedings under the Act against the Noticee to inquire into and adjudge the alleged violation of Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement read with Clause 5.1 of Schedule II of Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for Prevention of the Insider Trading under Regulation 12(2) of the PIT Regulations. Appointment of Adjudicating Officer 4. SEBI vide order dated July 16, 2012 appointed Shri Parag Basu as the Adjudicating Officer under section 15 I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Adjudication Rules’) to inquire into and adjudge under section 15HB of the SEBI Act and Section 23A (a) of the Securities Contract Regulation Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as 'SCRA') for the alleged violation of the abovementioned provisions of Listing Agreement and PIT Regulations by the Noticee. Consequent to the transfer of Shri Parag Basu, SEBI vide Order dated August 16, 2012 appointed me as the Adjudicating Officer. Notice, Reply & Personal Hearing 5. A Notice dated September 11, 2012 (hereinafter referred to as ‘SCN’) was issued to the Noticee in terms of Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be held against it for the alleged violations. The SCN was sent to the Noticee by Registered Post which was delivered and acknowledged by the Noticee. It was alleged in the SCN that Noticee violated Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement read with Clause 5.1 of Schedule II of Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for Prevention of the Insider Trading under Regulation 12(2) of the PIT Regulations. The Noticee vide letter dated October 05 2012 sought extension of time for filing reply to the SCN. However, the Noticee did No submit any reply to the SCN. 6. In the interest of natural justice and in order to conduct an inquiry as per Rule 4 (3) of the Adjudication Rules the Noticee was granted an opportunity of personal hearing on November 26, 2012 vide notice dated November 06, 2012. The personal hearing notice was sent to the Noticee by Registered Post which was delivered and acknowledged by the Noticee. Another opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on January 31, 2013 vide notice dated January 16, 2013. The Authorized Representative's (AR's) of the Noticee appeared for the hearing, filed written submissions dated January 30, 2013 and reiterated the said submissions. The Noticee vide letter dated January 30, 2013 inter alia denied all the allegations made against it. 7. In view of the above, I am proceeding with the inquiry taking into account of the submissions made before me, the documents and material as available on record. Consideration of Issues, Evidence and Findings 8. I have carefully perused the charges against the Noticee mentioned in the SCN, submissions made by the Noticee, the materials and documents as available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: a) Whether the Noticee has violated the provisions Clause 35 of the Listing Agreement read with Clause 5.1 of Schedule II of Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices for Prevention of the Insider Trading under Regulation 12(2) of the PIT Regulations? b) Does the violation, if any, on the part of the Noticees attract any penalty under section 15HB of the SEBI Act and Section 23A(a) of SCRA? c) If yes, what should be the quantum of penalty? 9. Before moving forward, it will be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of SAST and PIT Regulations which read as under:- SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 Regulation 12 Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities. 12. (1) All listed companies and organisations associated with securities markets including : (a) the intermediaries as mentioned in section 12 of the Act, asset management company and trustees of mutual funds ; (b) the self-regulatory organisations recognised or authorised by the Board; (c) the recognised stock exchanges and clearing house or corporations; (d) the public financial institutions as defined in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956; and (e) the professional firms such as auditors, accountancy firms, law firms, analysts, consultants, etc., assisting or advising listed companies, shall frame a code of internal procedures and conduct as near thereto the Model Code specified in Schedule I of these Regulations 45[without diluting it in any manner and ensure compliance of the same. (2) The entities mentioned in sub-regulation (1), shall abide by the code of Corporate Disclosure Practices as specified in Schedule II of these Regulations. Schedule II 5.0 Reporting Requirements for transactions in securities 5.1 All directors officers designated employees of the listed company shall be required to forward following details of their securities transactions including the statement of dependent family members (as defined by the company) to the Compliance Officer: (a) all holdings in securities of that company by directors officers designated employees at the time of joining the company; (b) periodic statement of any transactions in securities (the periodicity of reporting may be defined by the company. The company may also be free to decide whether reporting is required for trades where pre-clearance is also required); and (c) annual statement of all holdings in securities. 10. From the material available on record, I find that as disclosed at BSE website during the quarter ended September 2004, Shri K S Ramakrishna, promoter of Noticee was holding 20.83% of the shares of Noticee and SCFPL was holding 18.15% of the shares of Noticee. I find that the shareholding of SCFPL was erroneously shown in the promoter group and that a revised Clause 35 of Listing Agreement was filed with BSE for the quarter ended September 2004. As per the revised clause 35 of Listing Agreement, Shri K S Ramakrishna was holding 50.03% and SCFPL was No holding any of the shares of KGL. Also, there was a discrepancy with regard to information submitted by Noticee under Regulation 8(2) of SAST Regulations. 11. The following submissions were made by the Noticee: (a) In the quarterly filing for the quarter ended September 2004 under clause 35 of the Listing Agreement, Noticee had inadvertently disclosed the name of M s Simply Class Fashions Pvt Ltd (SCFPL) as one of the promoters with a shareholding of 18.15%. Infact at the relevant time SCFPL was No holding even a single share of the Noticee. The said bonafide error occurred at the end of Noticee's secretarial staff. The shareholding so erroneously disclosed against the name of SCFPL was actually held by Mr. K.S. Ramakrishna. Shareholding of Mr. K.S. Ramakrishna which at the relevant time stood at 38.98% shares was erroneously bifurcated and was reflected as 20.83% against his name and 18.15% against the name of SCFPL. Whereas the fact was that the entire 38.98% shares were in the name of K.S. Ramakrishna. (b) As a result of the said inadvertence, there was no change in the promoter shareholding. Since the consolidated shareholding of the promoter group continued to remain the same at 57.78%. therefore, as result of such inadvertence, the interest of the shareholders was No adversely affected. (c) Immediately on becoming aware of the said error discrepancy in the disclosure, the Noticee vide its letter dated January 03, 2012 filed the revised disclosure with the BSE correcting the error. (d) In so far as the information submitted by the Noticee to BSE and before investigating authority is concerned, the same was furnished by the Noticee based on the data provided by the Registrar to the Noticee with regard to the details of the shareholders and the number of shares held by them. All listed companies, prior to filing the details of shareholding seek data from their registrar and based on the same they file their disclosures. This is a normal market practice, which the Noticee has also followed. (e) In so far as the shareholding as disclosed by the Noticee to BSE under Regulation 8(3) of SAST Regulations is concerned, the same has been filed by the Noticee based on the receipt of disclosure by the company from the individuals entities under Regulation 8(2) of SAST Regulations. (f) The said disclosures are made to the Noticee by the individuals entities and the Noticee has in the absence of anything to excite its suspicion as to something exceptionally wrong, no role to play save and except ministerial role of forwarding the disclosures to the exchanges. 12. I concede with the submissions of the Noticee that the errors were inadvertent, unintended and did No cause any harm to the investors. Further, the Noticee has already taken steps to rectify the errors. I am of the view that the present case is No fit for warranting imposition of monetary penalty. Order 15. In view of the above, after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and exercising the powers conferred upon me under Section 15-I (2) of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby conclude that the charges leveled against the Noticee as per the SCN does No stand established and accordingly the matter is disposed of. 16. In terms of the Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.

During the period of investigation i.e. April 30, 2007 – November 18, 2008, MFMCL had sold 29, 94,394 shares and Roopshri sold 9, 08,025 shares. On analyzing the demat statement of MFMCL, it was noted that 2,95,300 shares were received in off market from another promoter Prudential Stocks & Securities Limited (client ID 14872936) since November 10, 2007. From these shares, only 34,700 shares were sold in the market during November 12-29, 2007 and balance 2, 60,600 shares were transferred to his another BO ID 1201090001221636. It is also observed that MFMCL had received 9, 60, 000 shares in off market on July 04, 2007 from Vinod Baid, CMD of GLL. However, Roopshri was holding 3, 32,000 shares as on April 1, 2007 and its purchase and sale were 6, 09,556 shares and 9, 08,025 shares respectively. 5. As per shareholding pattern for quarter ended June 2007, Vinod Baid was holding 9, 64, 800 shares (9.51% of the equity capital). Vinod Baid transferred 9,60,000 shares (9.46% of the equity capital) to MFMCL on July 04, 2007, and thus, Vinod Baid was required to disclose this transfer under Regulation 13(4) read with Regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992. On the other hand, Mercury was required to submit the disclosure under Regulation 7(1) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997 as well as Regulation 13(1) read with Regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992. The company in turn was required to disclose to Adjudication Order In Respect of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its Directors July 29, 2011 In The Matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd the stock exchanges under Regulation 13(6) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992 and Regulation 7(3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997. The company had allegedly No informed SEBI about any disclosure either under SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997 or SEBI (PIT) Regulations. Further, BSE has informed that during January 2007 – December 2008, it had received only one disclosure under SEBI (SAST) Regulations on 31.10.08 given by Religare Securities Ltd and no disclosure under SEBI (PIT) Regulations. 6. GLL had made certain corporate announcements during the investigation period, some of which were No implemented. It is noted that on July 4, 2007, immediately before the corporate announcement about investment proposal, MFMCL had received 9.60 lakh shares in off market from the promoter of GLL i.e. Vinod Baid and sold 9, 30,850 shares during July 5,2007 to August 22,2007. The price rise during this period was from Rs. 24.10 to Rs. 26.55. It is observed that the promoter has transferred the shares in off market to erstwhile promoter (MFMCL) which in turn sold them in the market taking advantage of the positive announcement by the Company which was never implemented and the Company had also No informed the stock exchanges about subsequent implementation status. It is indicative of the fact that the Company had planted a false announcement about the aforesaid investment proposal and Vinod Baid had sold his 9.60 lakh shares through MFMCL. MFMCL had facilitated Vinod Baid in off loading the shares of GLL in the market. This act of the company, Vinod Baid & MFMCL could have been an artifice device to defraud the investors in the market by presenting the company as a lucrative investing option on account of proposed foreign investors. Thus, they might have acted together to play fraud on innocent investors. In view of the same, it was of utmost importance to SEBI to be able to procure information about the corporate announcements and subsequent transfer of shares. 7. Summons were thereby issued to GLL to provide information. It has been alleged that GLL did No comply with the summons. It has been observed that Vinod Baid was the CMD and Shri U. C. Bhandari, Y. Ravinder Reddy and Kishore Jhunjhunwala were the Directors of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and were responsible for conduct of the business of the Company. According to Section 27 of the SEBI Act, 1992, \"Where an offence under this Act has been committed by a Adjudication Order In Respect of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its Directors July 29, 2011 In The Matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd company, every person who at the time the offence was committed was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.\" 8. In view of the aforesaid, it was alleged that the Company, Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its directors, Vinod Baid, U. C. Bhandari, Y. Ravinder Reddy and Kishore Jhunjhunwala violated the provisions of Sections 11 C (2), 11C (3) read with 11 C(6) of the SEBI Act, 1992. APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER 9. The undersigned was appointed as Adjudicating Officer (‘AO’) vide order dated March 29, 2011 under Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred as ‘Rules’) to enquire into and adjudge upon the alleged violations committed by the noticee under section 15 A (a) of the SEBI Act, 1992.

Noticee -3, Noticee – 4 and Noticee – 5 submitted letters dated July 20, 2011 wherein they stated that since they were independent, non-executive directors, they were No involved in the day-to-day functioning of GLL and had therefore No been in a position to comply with the summons. 12. Mr. KVLN Bhaswanth, Chief Operating Officer of GLL, attended the hearing along with Mr. Vinod Baid, Chairman and Director of GLL. Mr. Bhaswanth submitted that the officer dealing with the matter had left the service of the Adjudication Order In Respect of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its Directors July 29, 2011 In The Matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd company and he was No fully aware about the matter and hence the summons could No be complied with. In any case, the non-compliance was No intentional but could be because of a lack of understanding. He also submitted that Noticee – 2 (Vinod Baid) was the Chairman of the Board and was No involved in the day-to-day functioning of GLL.

It was reiterated that Noticee-3, Noticee-4 and Noticee-5 were independent directors on the Board and were No involved in day to day management. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION 13. On perusal of the SCN, Noticees’ submissions and other material available on record, I have the following Issues for consideration, viz., Whether the Noticees violated the provisions of Sections 11C (2) and 11C (3) read with 11 C (6) of the SEBI Act, 1992? Whether the Noticees are liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A (a) of SEBI Act, 1992?

Copy of PAN Card of the company.\" 16. Vide letter dated May 5, 2010, the Company submitted a partial reply to the summons wherein it stated that losses in quarter ended March 2008 was due to sluggish market conditions – both domestic & international. The company confirmed about complying with SEBI (SAST) Regulations & SEBI (PIT) Regulations but without supporting documents. The Company was evasive about the transaction between MFMCL and Vinod Baid and did No reply to all the questions asked. Adjudication Order In Respect of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its Directors July 29, 2011 In The Matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd 17. In view of the incomplete information submitted by the Company, summons dated May 20, 2010 were issued to the Company in continuation of the previous summons, to provide the following information: \"Please note that this is in continuation to our earlier summons dated April 26,2010 seeking specific information in the matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd Vide reply dated May 5,2010, some information was provided by the company but specific reply to the following queries is still to be given: a. Has Mercury Fund Management Co Ltd become the promoter of GLL due to common director Shri Kishore Jhunjhunwala? If yes, when Kishore Jhunjhunwala was appointed as director of GLL and also when he ceases to be director of GLL. b. Has Mercury Fund Management Co Ltd ceases to be the promoter of GLL once Shri Kishore Jhunjhunwala ceases to be director of GLL? c. The company has informed about compliance of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997 and SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992 as and when required. However, it may be noted that the information sought vide aforesaid summons was specific regarding the disclosures made by promoters etc. to the company as well as by the company to the stock exchange under the aforesaid regulations during April 01, 2007 to December 31, 2008 under SEBI. In view of the above, the company is advised to inform whether the disclosures were filed with the company for the following transactions: 1. The shareholding of Shri Vinod Baid is changed from 4800 shares (0.05% of the paid up capital) in March 2007 to 964800 shares (9.51% of the paid up capital) in June 2007 and require disclosure under Regulation 7(1) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 1997 as well as Regulation 13(1) read with Regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992. 2. Shri Vinod Baid transferred 9.60 Lakh shares to Mercury Fund Management Co Ltd on July 4, 2007. This transaction requires disclosure by Shri Vinod Baid under Regulation 13(3) read with Regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992. Similarly, Mercury Fund Management Co Ltd was also required to disclose under Regulation 7(1) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, Adjudication Order In Respect of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its Directors July 29, 2011 In The Matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd 1997 as well as Regulation 13(1) read with Regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992. 3. Mercury Fund Management Co Ltd was holding 16,36,036 shares (16.12% of the equity capital) for quarter ended March 2007 and it reduced to 1,19,086 shares (1.17% of the equity capital) for quarter ended June 2007. This change in shareholding is required to be disclosed under Regulation 13(3) read with Regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT) Regulations, 1992. The company is advised to inform whether the disclosures, as stated above, were made to the company by the respective entities and in turn, the same disclosures were made by the company to the stock exchanges. If yes, copy of the said disclosures with the acknowledgement proof may be provided. d. Copy of bank a c’s statements maintained by the company with State Bank of Hyderabad during January 01, 2007 – December 31, 2008. 18. Vide letter dated May 25, 2010, the Company asked for additional time of 3-4 weeks for filing reply to the summons. SEBI, vide letter dated May 26, 2010, advised the company to file reply to the aforesaid summons by June 7, 2010. Vide letter dated June 7, 2010, the Company submitted that it would file the desired information to SEBI by June 25, 2010. However, SEBI was No in receipt of any reply from the Company. 19. Noticee-1, the company, vide reply dated June 7, 2011 submitted that it had furnished relevant information as sought for by the Board vide its summons dated April 26, 2010, May 20, 2010 and May 26, 2010 (letter). However, it had noticed in the SCN that SEBI required specific information as to some queries as notified in page 8 of the Notice and therefore submitted the same as annexure to the reply. However I find that the information No also being submitted is No complete information as it has No provided the information on all the points raised in the summons. 20. During the course of the hearing, it was pointed out to Noticee-1 that the specific queries as laid down in the SCN were only a reproduction of the questions asked vide summons dated May 20, 2010, which the company had failed to comply Adjudication Order In Respect of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its Directors July 29, 2011 In The Matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd with. Summons dated May 20, 2010 was absolutely unambiguous about the information required from the company. 21. Noticee-1 submitted that it could No comply with the summons because the officer dealing with the matter had left the service of the company and the COO was No fully aware of the matter. The company submitted that this non- compliance with the summons was No intentional and could have been because of a lack of understanding. This contention of Noticee-1 cannot be accepted. 22. It was also submitted by the four directors that they were independent and non- executive directors who were No involved in the day –to-day management of the company and were therefore No in a position to comply with the summons. Mr. U. C. Bhandari, Mr. Y. Ravinder Reddy and Mr. Kishore Jhunjhunwala, in their replies dated July 20, 2011 have stated that they was non-executive directors and in the said capacity, their role in the management of the affairs of the company was very limited, more so in matters relating to transfer sale purchase of shares between the company and other entities and vice versa. During the course of the hearing, the Chief Operating Officer of the company also confirmed the submissions of the directors and stated that Mr. Vinod Baid was the Chairman of the Board and No involved in day to day functioning of the company. The company was managed by independent team of staff members headed by Mr. Gopal Krishnan, Executive Director (not the board member) assisted by COO Shri KVLN Bhaswanth and other staff members. Mr. Ravinder Reddy, Mr. Kishore Jhunjhunwala and Mr. U. C. Bhandari were the independent directors on the Board and were No involved in day to day management. I find that there is no evidence on record to suggest that these directors were involved in the day to day activities of the company. I therefore tend to give benefit of doubt to the Directors and I do No find Noticee-2, Noticee-3, Noticee-4 and Noticee-5 guilty of violating the provisions of Sections 11C (2) and 11C (3) read with 11 C (6) of the SEBI Act, 1992. 23. From the above discussion, I find that Noticee-1, Gennex Laboratories Ltd did No comply with the summons dated May 20, 2010 and therefore violated the provisions of Sections 11C (2) and 11C (3) read with 11 C (6) of the SEBI Act, 1992. Adjudication Order In Respect of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its Directors July 29, 2011 In The Matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd Issue 2: Whether the Noticees are liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A (a) of SEBI Act, 1992? 24. The allegations against Noticee-2, Noticee-3, Noticee-4 and Noticee-5 have No been established and they are therefore No liable for penalty under Section 15 A (a) of the SEBI Act of 1992. 25. Since the violation of the alleged provisions of law has been established in respect of Noticee-1, I believe that this is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under Section 15 A (a) of the SEBI Act, 1992, which reads as under: Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. 15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,— (a) to furnish any document, return or report to the Board, fails to furnish the same, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less; ISSUE 3: What should be the quantum of penalty imposed upon the Noticee in accordance with the principles of Section 15 J of the SEBI Act? 26. While imposing monetary penalty it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act, which reads as under: “15J - Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.” Adjudication Order In Respect of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its Directors July 29, 2011 In The Matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd 27. It is noted that no quantifiable figures are available to assess the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage made as a result of the default. Further, the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors also cannot be quantified on the basis of the available facts and data. However, such non-cooperation with investigative authorities leads to delay in the unraveling of unfair market practices, which results in the erosion of investor confidence in the market. 28. In the foregoing paragraphs it is No established that Noticee-1, Gennex Laboratories Ltd., failed to provide necessary information to the Investigating Authority of SEBI in response to the summons issued in terms of Section 11(3) of the SEBI Act, 1992. The said information was very relevant and important in the whole investigation process. It is noted that the company had made certain announcements which did No materialise but had lead to a rise in the price of its shares. During this period of price-rise, it was observed that promoter entities had offloaded their shares in the market. By No providing this crucial information which could have unraveled serious manipulative or fraudulent practices on the part of the company or entities related to it, Noticee-1 seriously crippled the investigative process. In this regard, I refer to the observation of the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No 184 of 2010 (Mr. Jalaj Batra vs. SEBI, decided on 06-12-2010); wherein it was held that - “…….Having regard to the circumstances of this case, we are more than satisfied that the summons had in fact been received by the appellant and that he failed to respond to the same. We have observed time and again that it is of utmost importance that market players like the appellant should fully cooperate with the investigations that are carried out by the Board, the watchdog of the securities market. If market players and intermediaries avoid appearing before the investigating officer or furnish the necessary information sought from them, the Board as a market regulator will No be able to carry out its statutory functions and duties of protecting the integrity of the securities market and the investigations would be grossly hampered. No co-operation with the market regulator has to be viewed seriously. We do No know what else would have come to light if the appellant had appeared before the investigating officer or if he had furnished the requisite information that was sought from him.............” Thereby, it is established beyond doubt that Noticee-1 tried to elude the Investigating Authority, which hampered the investigation process. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the violation committed by Noitcee-1, I am of the view that imposing a penalty of Rs. 10, 00,000 - (Rs. Adjudication Order In Respect of Gennex Laboratories Ltd and its Directors July 29, 2011 In The Matter of Gennex Laboratories Ltd Ten Lakhs only) on Gennex Laboratories Ltd would be commensurate with the violation of Section 11C (2) and 11C (3) read with Section 11 C (6) of the SEBI Act by Noticee-1. ORDER: 29. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, in terms of the provision of Section 15A (a) of SEBI Act and Rule 5(1) of the Rules, I hereby impose a penalty of Rs. 10, 00,000 - (Rupees Ten Lakhs only) on Gennex Laboratories Ltd for No compliance of summons issued by Investigation Authority. 30. The penalty shall be paid by way of demand draft drawn in favour of “SEBI – Penalties Remittable to Government of India” payable at Mumbai within 45 days of receipt of this order. The said demand draft shall be forwarded to Shri Ashish Kumar, DGM, Investigation Department, Securities and Exchange Board of India, Plot No C4-A, ‘G’ Block, Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra (E), Mumbai – 400 051. 31. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules 1995, copies of this order are sent to the noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India. Date: July 29, 2011 P. K. Bindlish Place: Mumbai Adjudicating Officer"

Shri Chirantan Mukherjee [PAN :AFAPM5112L] In the matter of Shelter Infra Projects Ltd. Background 1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as ‘SEBI’) has conducted investigation into the alleged irregularity in the shares of Shelter Infra Projects Ltd., formerly known as CCAP Ltd (hereinafter referred to as ‘SIPL’) and into the possible violations of the SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and the various Regulations made there under for the period from April 01, 2009 to September 22, 2009. 2. The Investigation, inter alia, revealed that the Board of Directors of SIPL approved a Shares Purchase Agreement at its meeting held on July 30, 2009 to be executed between the SIPL and the proposed acquirers on July 31, 2009 for the sale of the issued and subscribed equity share capital of the company held by the erstwhile promoters, as also change in management of the company. On August 07, 2009 the managers to the offer on behalf of the acquirer issued a public announcement to the equity shareholders of SIPL. 3. According to the Code of Conduct framed and approved by SIPL in terms of Schedule II of the PIT Regulations, the trading window of the company will remain closed during the period of announcement (ten days before and two after the public announcement) of periodical financial results and such other sensitive information like the one cited above. However, SIPL has No introduced any trading window during the above public announcement. Shri K. L. Surana, (Noticee No 1) was the Compliance Officer and the entities mentioned above at serial No. 2 to 8 were the directors of SIPL (herein after referred to as Noticee Nos.1 to 8 respectively and collectively the Noticees) and were present at the Board Meeting held on July 30, 2009. Allegedly the trading window remained open during the relevant period and Noticee No. 1 had not made any formal communication to the persons entities who are subjected to the window closure. The Noticees Nos. 2 to 8 being directors of the board failed to monitor or supervise the implementation of the code of conduct and to ensure the necessary compliances in this regard. 4. SEBI has therefore initiated adjudication proceedings under the Act against the Noticees to inquire into and adjudge the alleged violations of Regulation 12 (1) read with Clause 1.2 of Schedule I, Part A of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as PIT Regulations). Appointment of Adjudicating Officer 5. SEBI vide order dated June 18, 2012 appointed me as Adjudicating Officer under Section 15‐I of the SEBI Act read with Rule 3 of the SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Adjudication Rules’) to inquire into and adjudge under section 15 HB of the Act, the alleged violation of the Noticees. Show Cause Notice, Reply and Personal Hearing 6. I issued a common notice dated August 27, 2012 ('SCN') under Rule 4 of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should No be held against the Noticees and penalty be not imposed under Section 15 HB of the SEBI Act for their alleged violation of Regulation 12 (1) read with Clause 1.2 of Schedule I Part A of the PIT Regulations. 7. SIPL vide letter dated October 13, 2012 submitted a copy of the Death Certificate of Noticee No. 1 issued by the Department of Health and Welfare, Government of West Bengal dated May 22, 2012. Therefore, the proceedings against him stand abated. 8. The Noticee Nos. 2 to 8 submitted their respective replies to the SCN during the first half of September. The Noticees inter alia submitted as below: i. The Noticee No. 2 submitted that his role in SIPL was mainly that of job execution and bagging new jobs for the company. He being an engineer was No conversant with the SEBI Regulations and acted upon the advice of the Compliance Officer of the company, who did No inform him of the requirement of closing the Trading window before the Public Announcement, resulting in the lapse. He served the company for a year after it was acquired by new promoters and was still not informed about the lapse. ii. Noticees Nos. 3, 4 and 5 submitted that they joined SIPL on May 02, 2001, April 24, 2009 and September 29, 2007 respectively as independent directors. They were No involved in the day to day activities of the company and therefore are neither associated with the matter directly or indirectly. They are civil engineers and advice the company only on engineering matters. iii. Noticee No.6 submitted that he has no knowledge of SEBI rules and technicalities. He was a part‐time director when the company was acquired, he never had any active participation in the negotiations and his expertise is in engineering. He was requested by the company secretary to attend the Board meeting on July 30, 2009, in order to approve the Share Purchase Agreement, despite his ill health. He had no knowledge of the trading window remaining open when public announcement was made, and this amounting to a gross violation of SEBI Regulations, neither did the company secretary (also the compliance officer) inform him of the same. Had he known about the trading window, he would have definitely monitored to ensure the compliance of the same. iv. Noticee No 7 submitted that he is a civil engineer and therefore not conversant with SEBI Regulations. He acted on the advice of the compliance officer who did not inform him of the requirement to keep the trading window closed during public announcement. If he was informed of the same, he would have monitored implementation of the same without fail. He has been made a victim to the circumstances. v. Noticee No.8 submitted that he completely respects laws and rules of SEBI and had no intension to violate PIT Regulations. It is an established practice that director of a company acts on the advice of the compliance officer. As he was a civil engineer, he depended entirely on the advice given by the compliance officer in the case of the Share Purchase Agreement and purchasing of shares from the market in order to strengthen the shareholding of the promoters in terms of creeping acquisition. He would have monitored the implementation of the code of conduct had he been informed about the same. He has been diagnosed with cancer since June 2012 and is undergoing chemotherapy. He enclosed a copy of the certificate by the attending physician along with the reply. 9. After considering the reply submitted by the Noticees, I decided to conduct an inquiry in the matter and accordingly granted an opportunity of personal hearing to the Noticees on October 18 & 19, 2012 vide letter dated October 03, 2012. Noticee No 2 vide letter dated October 10, 2012 sought for an adjournment. The hearing notice issued to Noticee No. 4 returned undelivered. The remaining Noticees attended the hearing personally except for Noticee No. 8 and Noticee No.6 who were represented by their authorised representatives, and they reiterated the written submissions. The authorised representative additionally submitted that Noticee No. 6 was an independent director and his role was limited to providing professional advices, attending board meetings and No day to day management. They have ensured broad policies and procedures with respect to regulatory and statutory compliances. 10. I granted another opportunity of personal hearing to Noticee No. 2 and Noticee No. 4 on November 19, 2012 vide letters dated November 01, 2012. Noticee No. 2 attended the hearing and reiterated the written submissions made by him earlier. I granted another opportunity of personal hearing to Noticee No. 4 on November 30, 2012 vide letter dated November 20, 2012. Noticee No 4 appeared on November 30, 2012 and reiterated his written submissions. 11. In view of the above, I am proceeding with the inquiry taking into account the submissions made by the Noticees, documents and material as available on record. Issues, Evidence and Findings 12. I have carefully perused the charges leveled against the Noticees mentioned in the SCN, the written and oral submissions of the Noticees and all the materials as available on record. The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are: a) Whether the Noticees have failed to comply with Regulation 12 (1) of the PIT Regulations read with Clause 1.2 of Schedule I Part A of the PIT Regulations? b) Do the violations, if any, on the part of the Noticees attract any penalty under Section 15 HB of the SEBI Act? c) If yes, what should be the quantum of monetary penalty? 13. Before proceeding, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the PIT Regulations which read as under: Insider Trading Regulations Regulation 12 (1) – Insider Trading Regulations Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities. 12. (1) All listed companies and organizations associated with securities markets including: (a) the intermediaries as mentioned in section 12 of the Act, asset management company and trustees of mutual funds ; (b) the self‐regulatory organizations recognized or authorised by the Board; (c) the recognized stock exchanges and clearing house or corporations; (d) the public financial institutions as defined in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956; and (e) the professional firms such as auditors, accountancy firms, law firms, analysts, consultants, etc., assisting or advising listed companies, shall frame a code of internal procedures and conduct as near thereto the Model Code specified in Schedule I of these Regulations without diluting it in any manner and ensure compliance of the same. Schedule I – Part A Model Code of Conduct for prevention of Insider Trading for Listed Companies 1.2 The compliance officer shall be responsible for setting forth the policies, procedures, monitoring adherence to the rules for the preservation of ‘Price Sensitive Information”, pre‐clearing; of designated employees’ and their dependent trades (directly or through respective department heads as decided by the company), monitoring of trades and the implementation of the code of conduct under the overall supervision of the board of the listed company. Explanation: For the purpose of this schedule, the term ‘designated employee’ shall include:‐ (i) Officers comprising of the top three tiers of the company management (ii) The employees designated by the company to whom these trading restrictions shall be applicable, keeping in mind the objective of this code of conduct. 14. I find that the Noticee No 1 was the compliance officer, and Noticee Nos. 2 to 8 were the Board of Director of SIPL and were present in the Board Meeting held on July 30, 2009 when a Shares Purchase Agreement for the sale of 35.50 % of the issued and subscribed equity share capital of SIPL held by the erstwhile promoters to M s. Ramayana Promoters Pvt. Ltd. (Acquirer) as also change in control of the management of the company was approved. 15. The information that M s. Ramayana Promoters Pvt. Ltd. was taking over the Company became public only on August 7, 2009. I note that SIPL confirmed that no trading window was introduced during the above public announcement vide its letter dated April 04, 2010. Further, no separate letter was issued to the Board members instructing them of the commencement for the closing of the trading window and SIPL had left its trading window open during period of public announcement (ten days before and two days after the public announcement) in contravention to the Code of Conduct for prevention of insider trading followed by SIPL. It is an admitted fact that mere circulation of code of conduct to all the Board members during March end does No tantamount to a communication that the trading window had to be closed before the public announcement. A formal communication indicating the trading window to be closed ought to have been made before the public announcement by the Compliance Officer. 16. However, the Noticee No. 1 against whom the proceeding was initiated expired on May 17, 2010 and is no more alive to face the penalty. In light of the above, I am of the opinion that the proceeding against Noticee No.1 is liable to be abated without going into the merit of the case. 17. No let me examine the role of the board of directors. As per Clause 1.2 of Schedule I Part A of the PIT Regulations, 'The compliance officer shall be responsible for setting forth the policies, procedures, monitoring adherence to the rules for the preservation of ‘Price Sensitive Information”, pre‐clearing; of designated employees’ and their dependent trades (directly or through respective department heads as decided by the company), monitoring of trades and the implementation of the code of conduct' and this should be done 'under the overall supervision of the board of the listed company'. 18. As per Regulation 12 (1) of the PIT Regulations all companies shall frame a code of internal procedures and conduct as near there to the Model Code specified in Schedule I of the said Regulations without diluting it in any manner and ensure compliance of the same. The company being an artificial person acts through its board of directors and officers. 19. I find that SIPL has framed and adopted a code of conduct for prevention of Insider Trading as per Regulation 12 (1) of the PIT Regulations and there is no allegation of any short coming with respect to the same. The company board of directors has also appointed a compliance officer responsible for the implementation of the same. It is therefore the duty of the compliance officer to implement the code of conduct and in case of any difficulty in implementation he she should bring it to the attention of the board of directors and the board of director in turn shall remedy remove the difficulties. In my view, the above provision of law does not envisage the board of directors to monitor and supervise the day to day functioning of the compliance department of the company. The substantive corroborative evidences as available on record are insufficient to establish beyond doubt that Noticee Nos. 2 to 8 had done or not done anything with regard to trading window closure in connection with the public announcement which is in contravention of any provisions of the law. 20. From the foregoing findings and observations I conclude that the alleged violations against the Noticee Nos. 2 to 8 does not stand established and is not a fit case to impose any monetary penalty. Order 21. In view of the above, after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and exercising the powers conferred upon me under Section 15‐I (2) of the SEBI Act read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, I hereby abate the proceeding against the Noticee No. 1 and exonerate Noticee Nos. 2 to 8 from the charges leveled against them. Accordingly, the matter is disposed of. 22. In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudicating Rules the copies of this order are sent to the Noticees and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India.
