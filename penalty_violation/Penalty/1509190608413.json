(1) Any acquirer who acquires shares or voting rights in a target company which taken together with shares or voting rights, if any, held by him and by persons acting in concert with him in such target company, aggregating to five per cent or more of the shares of such target company, shall disclose their aggregate shareholding and voting rights in such target company in such form as may be specified.

(5) The disclosure mentioned in sub-regulations (3), (4) and (4A) shall be made within two working days of : (a) the receipts of intimation of allotment of shares, or (b) the acquisition or sale of shares or voting rights, as the case may be. … 16. The alleged violation of provisions of Regulation 29(1) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011 and Regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations is owing to the shareholding of the Noticee crossing 5% of the shares of IFL on August 12, 2013. Adjudication Order in respect of Dadimaa Capital Pvt Ltd in the matter of Insta Finance Limited 17. Further, the alleged violation of provisions of regulation 29(2) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011 and regulation 13(3) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations is owing to the change of more than 2% in Noticee’s shareholding in IFL on November 21, 2013 while holding more than 5% shares of IFL. 18. I note that the SCN and the notice of hearing have been duly served on the Noticee by way of affixture and hand delivery as noted above. However, the Noticee has neither replied to the SCN No has appeared for the hearing. It is also noted that vide its email dated February 05, 2014 to ISD, BSE has stated that it had No received any disclosures under PIT Regulations or SAST Regulations, 2011 from the Noticee for its transactions on August 12, 2013 and November 21, 2013. Further, with respect to said 2 transactions, it is also noted that, IFL vide its letter dated March 06, 2014 to ISD has stated, “..there is no question of disclosure under SEBI Regulations.” 19. In this regard, I refer to the following observation made by the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as ‘SAT’) in the matter Akriti Global Traders Limited. Vs SEBI (Appeal No 784 of 2014 decided on September 30, 2014): \"..Obligation to make disclosures under the provisions contained in SAST Regulations, 2011 as also under PIT Regulations, 1992 would arise as soon as there is acquisition of shares by a person in excess of the limits prescribed under the respective regulations and it is immaterial as to how the shares are acquired.” 20. From the observations made at paras 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19 above, it is concluded that the Noticee was required to make disclosures under the regulation 29(1) read with regulation 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011 and regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations and it has failed to do so. Adjudication Order in respect of Dadimaa Capital Pvt Ltd in the matter of Insta Finance Limited 21. From the observations made at paras 15, 17, 18 and 19 above, it is concluded that the Noticee was required to make disclosures under the regulation 13(3) read with regulation 13(5) of PIT Regulations and has failed to do so. 22. As regards the alleged violation of provisions of regulation 29(2) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011, I note that Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Mr. Ravi Mohan et.al. vs. SEBI ( Appeal no 97 2014 decided on December 16, 2015) has observed as follows: “……. 29. ……………Therefore, when the Takeover Regulations, 1997 provides that the disclosure obligation specified under regulation 7(1A) has to be discharged in the manner specified under regulation 7(1A) read with regulation 7(2) and regulation 7(2) does No provide for disclosure in relation to sale of shares in excess of the limits prescribed under regulation 7(1A), SEBI is No justified in holding that the appellants by failing to make disclosure of sales covered under regulation 7(1A) within the stipulated time, have violated regulation 7(1A) read with regulation 7(2) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997. Consequently, SEBI is No justified in imposing penalty on the appellants. ……. 33. For all the aforesaid reasons, the issues raised in these appeals are answered as follows:- a)……… b) Disclosure obligation under regulation 7(1A) has to be discharged in accordance with regulation 7(1A) read with regulation 7(2). Since regulation 7(2) does No contemplate for disclosure relating to sale of shares in excess of the limits set out under regulation 7(1A), appellants herein cannot be said to have failed to comply with regulation 7(1A) within the time stipulated under regulation 7(1A) read with regulation 7(2). Consequently penalty imposed on the appellants cannot be sustained. ……” 23. Keeping in view the text of the regulation 29(2) read with 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011, I note that the ratio of the aforesaid decision of the Hon’ble SAT is also applicable to the instant regulations. Therefore I conclude that the allegation that the Noticee has violated the provisions of regulation 29(2) read with regulation 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011 is No tenable. Adjudication Order in respect of Dadimaa Capital Pvt Ltd in the matter of Insta Finance Limited 24. In view of the conclusions arrived at paras 20 and 21 above, I conclude that the Noticee has violated the provisions of regulation 29(1) read with regulation 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011, regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations and regulation 13(3) read with regulation 13(5) of PIT Regulations. ISSUE II. Whether the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act? 25. From the conclusions arrived at para 24 above, I further conclude that the Noticee is liable for monetary penalty under section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act. The text of the said provision is as follows: 15A. Penalty for failure to furnish, information, return etc. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder, - (a)… (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less. … ISSUE III: If so, what quantum of monetary penalty should be imposed on the Noticee ? 26. While determining the quantum of monetary penalty, it is important to consider the factors stipulated in Section 15 J of the SEBI Act, which reads as under : SEBI Act Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer 15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under Section 15 I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely: Adjudication Order in respect of Dadimaa Capital Pvt Ltd in the matter of Insta Finance Limited a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or a group of investors as a result of the default ; c) the repetitive nature of the default 27. The material available on record has No quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, if any, made by the Noticee and the loss, if any, suffered by the investors as a result of the Noticee’s failures. From the documents available on record, it is noted that no prior default is on record. 28. With respect to the conclusion arrived at para 24 above regarding the regulation 29(1) read with regulation 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011 and regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, I also note that Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Vitro Commodities Private Limited Vs. SEBI (Appeal No 118 of 2013 decided on September 04, 2013) has inter alia observed, “It may be noticed that provisions of Regulations 7(1) of Takeover Regulations, 1997 and Regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 are No substantially different, since violation of first automatically triggers violation of second and hence there is no justification for imposition of penalty for second violation when penalty for first violation has been imposed. It may be seen that Regulation 7(1) of Takeover Regulations, 1997 and Regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 are No stand alone Regulations and one is corollary of other”. In light of the aforesaid Order by Hon’ble SAT, the said ratio is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the instant case with respect to the violation of regulation 29(1) read with regulation 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011 and regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations by the Noticee. 29. In view of the abovementioned conclusion along with notings made at para 28 above after considering the factors under Section 15J of the SEBI Act, I hereby impose a penalty of 1,00,000 - (Rupees One Lakh only) on the Noticee under Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act for the violation of regulation 29(1) read with regulation 29(3) of SAST Regulations, 2011 and regulation 13(1) of PIT Adjudication Order in respect of Dadimaa Capital Pvt Ltd in the matter of Insta Finance Limited Regulations and a penalty of 1,00,000 - (Rupees One Lakh only) on the Noticee under Section 15A (b) of the SEBI Act for the violation of regulation 13(3) read with regulation 13(5) of PIT Regulations, which is appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case. ORDER 30. In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 15 I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, and Rule 5 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995, I hereby impose a consolidated penalty of 2,00,000 - (Rupees Two Lakh only) on Dadimaa Capital Pvt Ltd in terms of the provisions of Section 15A(b) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 for the violation of regulations 29(1) read with regulation 29(3) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 and regulation 13(1) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 and regulation 13(3) read with regulation 13(5) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 by it. 31.
