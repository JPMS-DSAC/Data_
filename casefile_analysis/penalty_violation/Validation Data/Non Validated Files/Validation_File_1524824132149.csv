5,F1524824132149_S6,As per the Investigating Authority the Unpublished Price Sensitive Information “UPSI” in respect of the shares of MCX was the implication of the DCA SCN dated April 27 2012 issued to NSEL i.e  suspension of short selling by its Members pairing of contracts and settlement of contracts beyond 11 Adjudication Order in respect of Om Prakash Agarwal in the matter of MCX days and impending payment defaults by the members of NSEL and loss of reputation of Promoters and Management of MCX.
6,F1524824132149_S7,It was observed that any news impacting business of NSEL will automatically impact share price of its holding company i.e  FTIL and associate companies i.e  MCX and any news impacting credentials of Promoters and Management of FTIL NSEL and MCX will also impact the share price of MCX therefore suspension of trading by NSEL was a negative news.
7,F1524824132149_S8,As per the Investigating Authority the UPSI came into existence on April 27 2012 upon the issuance of the SCN to NSEL by the DCA and it ceased to exist when NSEL suspended trading in all contracts except eseries contracts and deferred settlement of all pending contracts on July 31 2013.

11,F1524824132149_S12,It was alleged that the Noticee being an insider before the outbreak of NSEL irregularities avoided losses by selling 1260 shares of MCX between April 05 2013 and June 13 2013 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Regulation 122 of SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations 2015 hereinafter referred to as “PIT Regulations 2015”.

24,F1524824132149_S25,Thereafter I planned to sale MCX stock as it showed downward trend and took a conscious decision sold MCX stock.
25,F1524824132149_S26,Looking to the downward price trend in MCX scrip I sold stock this cannot be linked to insider trading.
26,F1524824132149_S27, I was staying on a rented house and had booked a under construction residential flat.

28,F1524824132149_S29, I was not aware of UPSI period and selling of MCX stock was not to avoid loss but to realize the value of ESOPs received from employer.
29,F1524824132149_S30,This cannot be taken as violation of provisions of regulation 3i of PIT regulations 1992 as alleged.
30,F1524824132149_S31,I note that an Order dated January 05 2018 WTM order has been passed by the WTM of SEBI under sections 111 114b and 11B of SEBI Act in the scrip of MCX and the said order is arisen from the same set of facts as in the instant adjudication proceeding.
31,F1524824132149_S32,Considering the facts and circumstances of the case reply of Noticee and the WTM Order dated January 05 2018 the undersigned is of the opinion that the present matter can be decided on the basis of facts materials available on record without personally hearing the Noticee.
32,F1524824132149_S33,CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS 9.
33,F1524824132149_S34,The issues that arise for consideration in the present case are  I. Whether Noticee avoided losses by selling 1260 shares of MCX between April 05 2013 and June 13 2013 when in possession of UPSI and thereby violated provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992? and II.
34,F1524824132149_S35,Does the violation if any attract monetary penalty under section 15G of SEBI Act?
35,F1524824132149_S36,Adjudication Order in respect of Om Prakash Agarwal in the matter of MCX 10.
36,F1524824132149_S37,Before moving forward it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of PIT Regulations 1992 which reads as under “Prohibition on dealing communicating or counselling on matters relating to insider trading.
37,F1524824132149_S38,No insider shall— i either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person deal in securities of a company listed on any stock exchange when in possession of any unpublished price sensitive information; or” 11.
38,F1524824132149_S39,I have perused the written submissions of the Noticee documents available on record and the WTM order dated January 05 2018 in the same matter in different proceedings.
39,F1524824132149_S40,Having considered the same I record my findings hereunder.
40,F1524824132149_S41,I find that Noticee was a senior employee of NSEL i.e  Assistant Vice President Business Development of NSEL during UPSI period and in that capacity he was reasonably expected of having access to the UPSI which emanated from NSEL.
41,F1524824132149_S42,Further the transactions in question i.e  sale of 1260 shares of MCX between April 05 2013 and June 13 2013 as specified in the SCN is also a matter of record.
42,F1524824132149_S43,I note that WTM of SEBI vide Order dated January 05 2018 under sections 111 114b and 11B of SEBI Act on the same set of facts and allegations had exonerated certain individuals in a separate proceedings against them in the scrip of MCX and the period of UPSI was the same as in the SCN in the instant adjudication proceedings.
43,F1524824132149_S44,In the said WTM order there was a specific finding with regard to the periodicity of the UPSI which is as under “25.
44,F1524824132149_S45,Having answered the first issue in the affirmative the next issue for consideration is whether the “price sensitive information” was unpublished during the period of investigation.
45,F1524824132149_S46,In this regard it is noted that on October 3 2012 an article appeared in the Economic Times a widely distributed financial newspaper which contained information Adjudication Order in respect of Om Prakash Agarwal in the matter of MCX relating to the issuance of SCN dated April 27 2012 to NSEL majority of the contents of the SCN allegations against NSEL with regard to violation of conditions of DCA notification dated June 5 2007 and the gist of NSEL’s reply to the SCN.
46,F1524824132149_S47,The article also covered the possible action that could be taken by DCA against NSEL i.e  withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide the notification dated June 5 2007.
47,F1524824132149_S48,On a careful perusal of the newspaper article dated October 3 2012 I find that the publication of the said article made the following information public  DCA had issued a show cause notice dated April 27 2012 to NSEL hereby it had found fault with certain types of contracts which were being traded on NSEL.
48,F1524824132149_S49, There were allegations against NSEL that it was permitting short selling on its platform.
49,F1524824132149_S50,It was also alleged that NSEL did not have a stock check facility for validating a members position.
50,F1524824132149_S51, SCN also alleged that all contracts traded on NSEL with a settlement period exceeding11 days were in violation of the provisions of FCRA.
51,F1524824132149_S52, The conduct of NSEL was allegedly in violation of the conditions stipulated in the DCA notification dated June 5 2007.
52,F1524824132149_S53, NSEL had filed its reply to the SCN issued by DCA.
53,F1524824132149_S54, In the event of NSEL failing to file a satisfactory explanation DCA would withdraw the exemption granted vide notification dated June 5 2007 without any further communication.
54,F1524824132149_S55,In my view a reader of the newspaper article dated October 3 2012 containing the information noted above could have deduced the implications of the SCN dated April 27 2012 to a lesser or greater extent depending on his her exposure to the subject matter covered in the newspaper article.
55,F1524824132149_S56,In my view the newspaper article was not speculative in nature as it published precise facts relating to the issuance of SCN and also brought out specific contents of the SCN summarizing the allegations levelled against NSEL and the possible consequences thereof.
56,F1524824132149_S57,The article categorically mentioned that failure on part of NSEL to provide a satisfactory explanation to the allegations levelled in the SCN would result in withdrawal of exemption granted to NSEL vide Adjudication Order in respect of Om Prakash Agarwal in the matter of MCX notification dated June 5 2007.
57,F1524824132149_S58,The said withdrawal of exemption in turn would have had a cascading effect on the contracts being traded on NSEL payment defaults in relation thereto and the eventual loss to the reputation of the promoters management of NSEL.
58,F1524824132149_S59,Considering the above I find that the price sensitive information relating to the implication of the SCN dated April 27 2012 became public from the time when the article relating to the SCN dated April 27 2012 appeared in Economic Times on October 3 2012 and as such ceased to be UPSI from that date.
59,F1524824132149_S60,Accordingly the period during which the period the UPSI existed was from the issuance of the SCN to its publication i.e  from April 27 2012 to October 3 2012.”
60,F1524824132149_S61,I note that in the said order WTM inter alia held that since those individuals did not trade in the shares of MCX when in possession of UPSI the violation of regulation 3i of the PIT Regulations 1992 cannot be established against them.
61,F1524824132149_S62,I have also gone through the charges leveled against the Noticee in the SCN which have arisen out of the same set of facts identical to that of in the WTM Order and I do not find any reason to disagree with the view taken by the WTM about the periodicity of UPSI i.e  from April 27 2012 to October 3 2012.
62,F1524824132149_S63,Since there was no UPSI in existence at the time of sale of 1260 shares of MCX between April 05 2013 and June 13 2013 by the Noticee therefore I am inclined to conclude that violation of Regulation 3i of the PIT Regulations 1992 by the Noticee as alleged in the SCN dated December 14 2017 do not stand established.
63,F1524824132149_S64,Since the alleged violation is not established against the Noticee Issue No 2 requires no consideration.
64,F1524824132149_S65,ORDER 15.
65,F1524824132149_S66,For the aforesaid reasons Show Cause Notice EAD AO PM AA OW 31638 2017 dated December 14 2017 alleging violations of provisions of Regulation 3i of PIT Regulations 1992 read with Adjudication Order in respect of Om Prakash Agarwal in the matter of MCX Regulation 122 of PIT Regulations 2015 by the Noticee i.e  Shri Om Prakash Agarwal is disposed of without imposition of any penalty.
66,F1524824132149_S67,In terms of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copies of this order are sent to Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
