9,F1530099079223_S10,EAD2 SS SK 12 201819 from the date of receipt of disclosure from JPM i.e  on or before May 01 2015.
10,F1530099079223_S11,Upon inquiry by SEBI vide email dated January 03 2018 the Noticee had interalia submitted as under “…we have no proof of dispatch for letter dated 29042015 which was sent by post and for November 5 2015 intimation we are attaching the subject email as per Annexure 1 & 2.”
11,F1530099079223_S12,From the records it is noted that the intimation sent by the Noticee to BSE vide email dated November 07 2015 contained reply dated November 05 2015 with regard to disclosures filed by its promoters.
12,F1530099079223_S13,Vide email dated January 31 2018 BSE has confirmed that on April 29 2015 no disclosures were received from either JPM or the Noticee in terms of the requisite provisions of the PIT Regulations.
13,F1530099079223_S14,However BSE informed that they have taken on record the disclosure date as November 05 2015 considering the date when Noticee’s letter dated November 05 2015 was received by BSE.
14,F1530099079223_S15,After examining the information available on record SEBI has alleged that the Noticee had made the requisite disclosures received from JPM to BSE belatedly i.e  on November 05 2015 instead of the actual due date viz.
15,F1530099079223_S16,May 01 2015.
16,F1530099079223_S17,Therefore it has been alleged that the Noticee has violated the provisions of Regulation 136 of the PIT Regulations.
17,F1530099079223_S18,In view of the above SEBI felt satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to adjudicate upon the aforesaid alleged violations by the Noticee and on March 07 2017 appointed  Mr Suresh Gupta Chief General Manager as Adjudicating Officer AO to inquire and adjudge the alleged violations of the provisions of regulation 134 and 4A read with 13 5 of the PIT Regulations by the Noticee.
18,F1530099079223_S19,When the records of the proceedings were provided to him on November 16 2017 the AO had remitted back the matter to the concerned department in SEBI seeking clarification evidence on November 21 2017.
19,F1530099079223_S20,By a common communication order dated April 02 2018 issued by a Deputy General Manager of SEBI this case has been transferred to me with advise that except for the change of the Adjudicating Officer the other terms and conditions of the original orders ‘shall remain unchanged and shall be in full force and effect’ and that the “Adjudicating Officer shall proceed in accordance with the terms of reference made in the original orders read with this order” .i.e  communication –order dated April 02 2018.

30,F1530099079223_S31,An opportunity of personal hearing was granted to the Noticee on June 26 2018 in terms of Rule 4 3 of the Adjudication Rules when Ms. Shailashri Bhaskar Authorized Representative AR of the Noticee appeared on his behalf and reiterated the submissions made by the Noticee vide its letter dated June 04 2018.The replies submissions of the Noticee are as follows a.
31,F1530099079223_S32,JPM’s wife Mrs. Gayatri Minda the deceased shareholder belonging to promoter group of the Noticee was holding 73029 shares which constituted 1.89% of the paid up capital of the company.
32,F1530099079223_S33,On her demise the shares held by her were transmitted to JPM who is also part of the promoter group of the Noticee.
33,F1530099079223_S34,Adjudication Order in respect of Jay Ushin Limited Ref No.
34,F1530099079223_S35,EAD2 SS SK 12 201819 b.
35,F1530099079223_S36,JPM had made the disclosures about such transmission of shares on April 29 2015 i.e  within the stipulated timeline and the Noticee immediately made a disclosure under Regulation 136 to BSE by post on April 29 2015.
36,F1530099079223_S37,However it was surprised to receive an email from SEBI and also from BSE requesting it to provide the details of this transaction and the disclosures made in this regard.
37,F1530099079223_S38,Therefore the Noticee once again submitted the disclosures under Regulation 136 to BSE on 07.11.2015.
38,F1530099079223_S39,Thus the requisite disclosures were made to BSE on time without any delay. c.
39,F1530099079223_S40,The change in the shareholding was reflected in the Shareholding Pattern filed by the Noticee for the quarter ended June 30 2015 and the same was available in public domain.
40,F1530099079223_S41,Further the transmission was only amongst promoters and no fresh shares were also acquired and there was no change in the shareholding of the promoter group. d.
41,F1530099079223_S42,In Form D prescribed under regulation 134 134A and 13 6 of the PIT Regulations the acquisition by way of transmission of shares are not required to be disclosed.
42,F1530099079223_S43,The intention of the regulation does not seem to mandate the disclosure of acquisitions by way of transmission of shares.
43,F1530099079223_S44,This proposition is further supported by the fact that in the Form D prescribed for the disclosures to be made under the new PIT Regulations of 2015 the acquisition by way of interse transfer of shares was added but acquisition by way of transmission is omitted.
44,F1530099079223_S45,Nevertheless the disclosures were made by the Noticee on April 29 2015 to the BSE by post.
45,F1530099079223_S46,In this regard the learned AR relied upon the copy of the requisite Form D signed by the authorized signatory of the Noticee on April 29 2015.
46,F1530099079223_S47,However proof of dispatch of Form D to BSE is not available with the Noticee.
47,F1530099079223_S48,The learned AR further submitted that the disclosures available on BSE proved that the disclosures were at least made on November 09 2015.
48,F1530099079223_S49,The AR also produced the extract of the disclosure made on BSE to demonstrate that the disclosures about transmission of shares to the Noticee as alleged were made on November 09 2015. e.
49,F1530099079223_S50,The learned AR and relied upon case laws referred in the reply of the Noticee and argued that Adjudicating Officer SEBI in the matters Devyani Chandrakant Doshi Rajoo Engineers Ltd and in the matter of D Sarojanamma ERP Soft System Ltd and Sanwaria Agro Oils Ltd wherein it is has been stated that Transmission is brought about by operation of law and is not a voluntary act like transfer of shares and hence does not require disclosures under the SEBI SAST Regulations 2011 and the SEBI PIT Regulations 1992.
50,F1530099079223_S51,Adjudication Order in respect of Jay Ushin Limited Ref No.
51,F1530099079223_S52,EAD2 SS SK 12 201819 7.
52,F1530099079223_S53,I have considered the allegations levelled in the terms of reference the aforesaid submissions of the Noticee and the relevant material available on record.
53,F1530099079223_S54,In this case the acquisition of 73029 shares of the Noticee by JPM pursuant to transmission of those shares from his deceased wife is admitted.
54,F1530099079223_S55,The charge is that the Noticee had made belated disclosure under regulation 136 of the PIT Regulations.
55,F1530099079223_S56,The Noticee has also claimed that it had made disclosures on April 29 2015 but has not been able to establish its claim on the basis of any proof evidence.
56,F1530099079223_S57,I also note from record that BSE had confirmed that it had received the disclosures about impugned acquisition from the Noticee on November 05 2015.
57,F1530099079223_S58,With regard to status of legal heirs it is a settled position that the property of the deceased member vests in the legal members of the deceased and transmission of shares to legal heirs of deceased shareholder is not a voluntary act as in case of transfer of shares.
58,F1530099079223_S59,As held by the Company Law Board in the matter of S. Kanthimathy S. Lakshmi S. vs  The Woodlands Estates Limited decided on 20 August 2007 2008 144 Comp Cases 830 CLB 2008 83 SCL 491 CLB when a shareholder dies his legal representatives represent the estate of that shareholder and that when a member dies his estate is entrusted in the legal representatives.
59,F1530099079223_S60,It is sufficient if ones predecessor in interest had invested the funds and any person who succeeded to shares by way of operation of law can be treated as shareholder representing the estate of deceased shareholder.
60,F1530099079223_S61,Further Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal hereinafter referred to as ‘SAT’ in the matter of Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi Vs.
61,F1530099079223_S62,SEBI Appeal No 64 of 2014 decided on May 08 2014 had concurred with the view of an Adjudicating Officer in the order in the matter of D Sarojanamma dated November 29 2013 that “….while transfer of shares relates to a voluntary act on the part of the shareholder transmission is brought about by the operation of law.” .
62,F1530099079223_S63,In Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi’s case the Adjudicating Officer of SEBI had imposed monetary penalty upon Mrs. Devyani Chandrakant Doshi for making delayed disclosures about her acquisition of shares in Rajoo Engineers Ltd by way of transmission of shares from her husband since deceased.
63,F1530099079223_S64,In appeal filed by the said Devyani Chandrakant Doshi Hon’ble SAT remanded back the matter to the Adjudicating Officer who later by an order dated March 24 2015 held that the charge against said Devyani Chandrakant Doshi was not established and exonerated her.
64,F1530099079223_S65,Further by an order dated December 28 2017 passed by another Adjudicating Officer in the matter of Sanwaria Agro Oils Ltd it was concluded that nondisclosure of acquisition by way of transmission of shares sans any voluntary act on the part of promoter was not a fit case for imposition of monetary penalty and exonerated the concerned promoter from the charges levelled against her.
65,F1530099079223_S66,Adjudication Order in respect of Jay Ushin Limited Ref No.
66,F1530099079223_S67,EAD2 SS SK 12 201819 10.
67,F1530099079223_S68,In the instant case also the acquisition by JPM a promoter of the Noticee was by way of transmission of shares to him from his deceased wife who was also a p romoter of the Noticee.
68,F1530099079223_S69,There was no change in the promoter shareholding per se and acquisition was by way of operation of law as opposed to any voluntary act of acquisition on the part of JPM.
69,F1530099079223_S70,In the facts and circumstances of this case the act of the Noticee cannot be said to be blameworthy and in my view the charge is technical and venial.
70,F1530099079223_S71,Considering the aforesaid principles of law endorsed by Hon’ble SAT I am of the view that the present case also would not be a fit case for imposition of section 15A b of the SEBI Act.
71,F1530099079223_S72,In view of the above I conclude that the case does not warrant imposition of any monetary penalty and exonerate Jay Ushin Limited from the charges levelled against it in the SCN.
72,F1530099079223_S73,The SCN is disposed of accordingly.
73,F1530099079223_S74,In terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules copies of this order is sent to the Noticee and also to SEBI.
