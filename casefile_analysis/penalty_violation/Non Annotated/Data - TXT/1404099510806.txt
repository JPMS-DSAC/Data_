Whether the Noticee had violated the provisions of regulation 13(4) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992 and clause 4.2 of Model Code of Conduct specified in Part A of Schedule I read with regulation 12(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992? b.

If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of SEBI Act? 8. Before moving forward, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of PIT Regulations, 1992 which reads as under:- SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 Code of internal procedures and conduct for listed companies and other entities. 12. (1) All listed companies and organisations associated with securities markets including : (a) the intermediaries as mentioned in section 12 of the Act, asset management company and trustees of mutual funds ; (b) the self-regulatory organisations recognised or authorised by the Board; (c) the recognised stock exchanges and clearing house or corporations; (d) the public financial institutions as defined in section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956; and (e) the professional firms such as auditors, accountancy firms, law firms, analysts, consultants, etc., assisting or advising listed companies, shall frame a code of internal procedures and conduct as near thereto the Model Code specified in Schedule I of these Regulations 45 without diluting it in any manner and ensure compliance of the same.

Finding The issues for examination in this case and the findings thereon are as follows: (a) Whether the Noticee had violated the provisions of regulation 13(4) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992 and clause 4.2 of Model Code of Conduct specified in Part A of Schedule I read with regulation 12(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 ? 9. It was observed during examination that • Noticee was a director of IGSL • Noticee had traded in the scrip with Gross Buy quantity of 730969 shares and Gross Sale quantity of 735904 shares, Adjudication order in the matter of M s Inventure Growth & Securities Ltd June27 , 2014 during the period of examination i.e. from August 04, 2011 to July 05, 2012 • Noticee had entered into opposite transactions within six months following the prior transaction. • Noticee's shareholding had changed by more than 25000 shares at many instances. 10. Based on the above, it was alleged in the SCN that the Noticee, being a director had entered into opposite transactions within six months following the prior transaction and has thus violated clause 4.2 of Model Code of Conduct specified in Part A of Schedule I read with regulation 12(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992. 11. It was also alleged in the SCN that since the Noticee was a director and that change in Noticee's shareholding exceeded the bench limit of 25000 shares as specified under regulation 13(4) of PIT Regulations, 1992, Noticee was required to disclose his shareholding to the company i.e. IGSL and the stock exchange i.e. BSE and NSE within two days from the date of such acquisition or sale of shares , but failed to do so thereby violated the provisions of regulation 13(4) read with regulation 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992. 12. Noticee in his reply has submitted that he was appointed as director of IGSL on September 15, 2012. He was designated to the post of whole time director on September 20, 2012 and he resigned as director w.e.f. May 17, 2013. Noticee also submitted that he has No traded in the scrip of IGSL after being appointed as a director and therefore No liable to make disclosure under PIT Regulations, 1992. Adjudication order in the matter of M s Inventure Growth & Securities Ltd June27 , 2014 13. Upon careful submissions of the documents available on record and the reply of the Noticee, I find that the Noticee traded from August 04, 2011 to July 05, 2012. I also find from the reply of the Noticee that he was appointed as the director of IGSL on September 15, 2012 and was No a director during the relevant period when he traded in the scrip. Since the Noticee was No a director during the relevant period, the provisions of regulation 13(4) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992 and clause 4.2 of Model Code of Conduct specified in Part A of Schedule I read with regulation 12(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 are No attracted. Therefore, I find no merit in the allegations made against the Noticee in the SCN. ORDER 14. In view of the foregoing, the alleged violation of the provisions of PIT Regulations, 1992 by the Noticee, as specified in the SCN dated April 22, 2014, does No stand established and the matter is, accordingly, disposed of. 15. In terms of rule 6 of the Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India. DATE: JUNE 27, 2014 A.
